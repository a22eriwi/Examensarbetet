483,fcmb8d,False,Question,125,"""Iceberg"" or no ""Iceberg"", CFR 0.2% or 2%, the real question is whether the hospital system will be able to support the load once COVID-19 becomes widely distributed. What can we look to for this?",COVID19,"There was a good discussion by Dr. Fauci in NEJM which has been posted before, ""Covid-19: Navigating the uncharted"" [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387?query=RP](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387?query=RP) which draws upon the idea of a so-called iceberg of mild cases, which will ultimately drive down the fatality rate. Some WHO experts and Chinese experts have disputed this, arguing that the 2% CFR remains supported. I would posit that recent evidence of undetected spread within Washington argues that there is an iceberg, and South Korean data, though still very preliminary, is pointing to a lower CFR (I think it's 0.64% so far).

The thing is, I know that a CFR of around 0.1% might be akin to influenza, but I don't think that R-naught and CFR paint the whole picture socioeconomically; it is important to know what the threshold is above which hospitals will become overwhelmed in numerous major cities, which would really raise this into a humanitarian crisis.

I think it is much harder to estimate what the situation would look like if CFR is somewhere like 0.6%, as there are no good comparisons to what that looks like.

**tl;dr CFR remains debatable, probably somewhere between 0.2% and 2.0%, but what really matters will be whether it's enough to overwhelm the healthcare system broadly.**

**Does anyone have a good English-translated or English-language report of what the situation on the ground in South Korea looks like?** I think this may be an informative model for what to expect in several weeks in the USA and elsewhere in best-case scenarios, as SK is taking very reasonable measures, while doing so with more transparency and less draconian measures than China.

**EDIT: I don't intend to try to calculate CFR. My premise is that the CFR will remain uncertain for some time due to the multiple variables that play into it. I just used those numbers as examples, because regardless of where it falls within that range, recent epidemics/pandemics are not easily comparable to this.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcmb8d/iceberg_or_no_iceberg_cfr_02_or_2_the_real/,270,"Are those really reasonable bounds?

-Highest fatality rate is for people over 80, at 14.8%

-Among existing conditions, heart disease is highest risk, followed by diabetes, then chronic respiratory disease, then high blood pressure

-Fatality increase with age. There are no deaths of children under 9. Death rate under 39 years is 0.2%. 40-49 years is 0.4%. 50-59 years is 1.3%. 60-69 years is 3.8%. 70-79 years is 8%. 

-Men are more likely to die (2.8%) than women (1.7%)

When people here simply don't believe the threat exists, or at the very least suggest that taking it seriously is 'panicking,' you get threads like this one.  This subreddit is extremely averse to speaking about the virus in anything other than an optimistic light, yet it believes that the sky is falling in our approach to mitigating the deaths.

We are setting back cancer research, as if research wouldn't be affected by the deaths of Principal Investigators of academic labs.  We are hurting everyone's mental health, as if that wouldn't be hurt by people's family members dying.

This sub's adamant refusal to believe that the virus is a grave threat makes you believe that the costs we're paying with social distancing are too high.  And yes, we are paying costs.

It has an interesting Table S1 with proportions of severe/critical by age. The discussion on page 11 show the odds ratios (20-40 as baseline=1): (strangely no info about 10-20, it may be a misprint):

* <=10: 0.33
* 20-40: 1.00
* 40-60: 1.44
* 60-80: 2.76
* >=80: 5.11

Since the mortality has steeper odds ratio, it seems that young people have lowered sever incidence but most importantly have better odds of surviving that. And if I'm not wrong recalculating the absolute values with these odds data, the critical cases are:

* <=10: 0.5%
* 20-40: 1.5%

I was playing games on my computer when I gradually started feeling weak over the span of an hour I'd say. I was starting to lose concentration of what I was doing in the game and at some point, it was like someone had opened the door of a really cold freezer next to me. I started shivering, slowly at first, but enough that I went to my room to put warmer clothes.

At that point, my concentration was affected enough that I did not even want to continue playing the game on the computer. I went to my bed (shivering uncontrollably in my warm clothes) and put on 2 blankets on top of me. That night turned out to be a terrible time. I gradually stopped shivering and instead started sweating. I kept trying to sleep but I was having all sorts of weird thoughts until, the sweating was so bad, that I had to take everything off of me. I was also feeling thirsty, my throat was super dry, but I was also feeling so weak, that I did not want to get out of the bed to go get a glass. The dryness was so bad that I had to kick myself in the ass and try to go get some water.

I remember , trying to get out of the bed was so hard that I literally crawled to the kitchen. Once there, I realized that I had to stand up to get a glass. I was feeling so weak and out of breath from the crawl that I rested on the floor of the kitchen a good 15 minutes before gathering the energy to lift myself on the counter to open the cabinets. I slowly got my glass and then opened the fridge to get a pitcher of cold water that i had in there. It was so hard to lift the pitcher that I almost fainted from shortness of breath. I brought the pitcher to the floor and collapsed next to it, taking another 15-20 minute rest before gathering my energy again to pour the water into my glass.

Drinking the water made me feel somewhat better but I dreaded the energy it would take to go back to my bed. So I slept on the kitchen floor for the remainder of the night. Some dark thoughts went through my mind. I wanted to call an ambulance, but I felt like if I did, nothing they would do could make me feel any better. I convinced myself that if my time had come... so be it. I am 37 year old, with a healthy weight. I run 3 times a week and do long bicycle rides on the weekends. I am no athlete but I consider myself above average fitness. Never have I felt so sick in my life.

Naturally, I got better the next day. Went to see a doctor and he told me that I had a simple cold, without much examination, and that drinking water and having some rest was the only thing to do. That was 3 years ago, is this what having the coronavirus feel like ? I sure hope not because that was the worst experience of my life ! ",2020-03-14 15:33:23

In addition to the hardest-hit regions in Italy, we also show this for the province of Bergamo.

What will it mean if SARS-Cov2 does become a pandemic? Should it be considered one already?

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ystkFwEqEV7Vt5JJbo3jRwtiuRiphDqK6\_NmStu3a-o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ystkFwEqEV7Vt5JJbo3jRwtiuRiphDqK6_NmStu3a-o/edit?usp=sharing)

At 10.00PM-11.00 GMT this evening - Tuesday 25 Feb - I'll be doing a live AMA on what it means for COVID19 to be declared a pandemic or not.

The link post above takes you through to some background reading, based on my background as a Senior Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in the UK, a policy think tank that works closely with UK and international governments on resilience and security policy. I worked at RUSI from 2007-2017 before moving into academia where I currently research global health (in particular, antibiotic resistance in India) and health information exchange online. My PhD was on reddit, and health information exchange during the Ebola outbreak.

Pandemic disease spread is the highest risk on the UK's National Risk Register, resulting in preparedness plans across many government agencies and strategies to keep healthcare, supply chains, energy and transport infrastructure running smoothly should such an eventuality come to pass. Most of the UK's plans - like those of most countries - are publicly available online and can provide reassurance that consequences have been considered, and that work is ongoing behind the scenes to minimise any impact the disease will have.

Is there any evidence that suggest people with autoimmune disorders or suppressed immune systems are higher-risk? For both infection, as well as severity? I'm particularly interested in the cytokine response as that seems highly dependent on ones immune system overreacting.

I'm overall a healthy, 28 y/o male. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't worry that much, as I'm healthy, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, etc. etc. That said, I have an undiagnosed auto-immune *something*, but the extensive number of doctors and specialists that I've seen haven't been able to figure out what it was. Bouts of previous IgA Vasculitis (haven't had for a few years, but lasted between ages 14-24ish), now chronic uveitis. Otherwise, I have no other symptoms and live a very normal life. I don't take immunosuppressants but have in the past taken prednisone. I do take prednisolone drops for my uveitis. Also lasting kidney damage and reduced kidney function from the IgA Vasculitis.

I'm very very anxious about this pandemic, but should I necessarily be this worried? I tried to bring these concerns up with my friends and roommates who I live with to be more vigilant about cleaning and disinfecting, but they just brush it off saying 'its the flu, unless your 70+ or have other problems going on you'll be fine'.

New York City is excellent at reporting deaths to NHCS so it has been easy to track real time. I've been posting for weeks about the surge in excess mortality in NYC. They don't show results by age group, but based on some other data mining I've done, I bet it is possible to dig up.

I did do a comparison of 2018 mortality (a bad flu season) for February-April with 2020 weekly UCOD data at a national level. Despite the 2020 data being incomplete - data was reported deaths as of 5/6 -  (and also because most states suck at timely submission of death certificates - I'm especially looking at you Connecticut and North Carolina), every age group 25 and up (except, oddly, Women 45-54) is showing an increased death rate. Two increases that jumped out as Men 25-34 nationally had a 4.6% increase in deaths, and 35-44 an 11.3% increase in deaths.

The prevailing narrative is that this is disease that is only dangerous for the old and infirm. While it's true that the IFR is much higher for the elderly, I think the reality is that the *relative* risk is pretty severe across most age groups.

Going to pull the data again in the next couple of days, try to do a comparison over multiple years for NYC and put together a visualization of excess deaths by 10 year age group. ",2020-05-11 20:31:30

That means 11% of the known cases that would have progressed to resolution, on average, had died at the time of the study.

The vast majority of the cases included in the snapshot had not resolved. The majority of the cases were likely still at risk of resolving in death vs recovery. Almost three weeks later South Korea still isn't reporting 7,755 resolved cases.

346,fcwcn7,False,Question,303,To mask or not to mask: the seemingly endless debate,COVID19,"I live in Canada but used to live in Asia. And so I'm conflicted on this topic, because I see two very different points of view.

**Western Point of View:** It's Irresponsible to Wear a Mask When You Aren't Sick

I'm seeing an ever-increasing number of articles from Canada / USA / UK telling people NOT to wear masks unless they are sick. Notably, the [US Surgeon General](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160) tweeted as much a few days ago.

The main arguments against wearing one seem to be:

* It's causing a shortage of masks globally  
* People don't know how to use them properly, and may get infected by touching their face to readjust 
* The cheap surgical masks don't even work 

**Eastern Point of View:**  It's Irresponsible NOT to Wear a Mask When You Aren't Sick

On the other hand, I'm hearing from first hand reports in Korea that right now it's very socially taboo NOT to wear a mask. Certain malls or restaurants won't let people enter without a mask. 

The main arguments for wearing one seem to be:

* Any protection is better than nothing 
* Wearing one prevents you from touching your face
* You may be asymptomatic and sick without knowing it
* And perhaps [a sense of solidarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/opinion/coronavirus-face-mask-effective.html) (we are all in this together, instead of stigmatizing only the sick wearing masks) 

**Can This Debate Be Solved?**

As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it becomes more important than ever that the health authorities can agree on what is good health practice. And yet here we are, with radically different policies on masks implemented on different sides of the world. 

I'll ""show my cards"" on this issue: I have bought masks and intend to wear them if my city has a growing number of cases. After living in Asia I got used to wearing one when air quality was bad, so it's not a big deal for me. 

Still, I want to make an informed decision on the issue and not wear something that's useless. If the science is clear against wearing masks when healthy, I'll change my view. But all I've seen so far are opinions, not data.

So the question remains... to mask or not to mask?",https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcwcn7/to_mask_or_not_to_mask_the_seemingly_endless/,404,"> It's causing a shortage of masks globally

Can be countered by: Failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part. I've bought a small contingent of surgical masks for my family I intend to reuse (soaking in 70% isopropanol overnight should do the trick).

Why the emergency planners world wide (with a few exceptions) sat on their hands since mid-January while being unprepared to start with is a very good question which I hope will receive a follow-up. ",2020-03-03 15:40:19

As you might be aware, two serological survey results from Geneva and New York City are more reliable sources to base our IFR estimation due to their methodology and scale (i.e., high immunity prevalence). As shown in the above comment and another comment of mine in the following:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gd7w7a/infection\_fatality\_rate\_of\_sarscov2\_infection\_in/fpgngb0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gd7w7a/infection_fatality_rate_of_sarscov2_infection_in/fpgngb0/)

Rather surprisingly, two IFR estimates from Geneva and New York City almost coincide with eath other, i.e., 1.23%-1.29%. I think we are approaching some semblance of the true IFR figure finally.

I must add that, as many recent serological research results where [the infected population is young and, sometimes, mostly female](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gd7w7a/infection_fatality_rate_of_sarscov2_infection_in/fpgngb0) (which was the case for the study from Gangelt), have shown so far, **we are likely to see relatively small IFR figures from research results conducted in areas with low seroprevalence** because young people are active spreaders due to their high mobility pattern and thusly the infected population is relatively young. In this light, **it is very dangerous to try to estimate the true IFR figure from these survey results with low prevalence**, not to mention that [the average inter-event delay](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g6pqsr/nysnyc_antibody_study_updates/fohxjrh/) between death (23.8 days) and antibody formation (14 days) must be considered.

Recovered patients may still be infectious

In   a grim assessment, a key Chinese respiratory disease expert described   the situation of the epidemic as a “see-saw battle”, despite the drop  in  daily recorded cases in recent days.

“We   should not be relaxed. The figure may go up again,” said Zhao  Jianping,  head of an expert team working to contain the outbreak in  Hubei.

Zhao told the magazine *Southern People Weekly*   there were cases in China in which recovered patients continued to  show  traces of the virus through nucleic acid tests. There were similar   results in Canada, where nose and throat swabs taken from a couple who   had recovered from Covid-19 revealed they still had traces of the  virus.

* **Incubation Period:** 2-14 days [7](https://bit.ly/2T9cOXS)

* **Persistence on Inanimate Surfaces:** Highly dependent on surface and conditions. *Possibly* up to 9 days, but generally less than that [27](https://bit.ly/395aXIW),[29](https://bit.ly/3akp2CJ)

**Symptoms:** Fever, cough, SOB [8](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html). *It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.* After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath, with about **20% of patients requiring hospital treatment**. Notably, the COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat [9](https://bit.ly/2VCYOH8). Some atypical patients [may present](https://bit.ly/2TsQOWA) initially with GI symptoms.

**Clinical Features**: 
Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness. In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days. Between 23–32% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support. [30](https://bit.ly/2PzOzzD)

Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent *serious* manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. Most infections are not severe, although many patients have had critical illness. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity, 81 percent were mild (no or mild pneumonia). In a study involving patients with pneumonia, ""**lymphopenia** was common, and all patients had parenchymal lung abnormalities on computed tomography of the chest, including bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities. ... Among the six patients who died, D-dimer levels were higher and lymphopenia was more severe compared with survivors. [23](https://bit.ly/32ytr2b)

**Treatment**:

Healthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. ... The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. ... No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. **Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.** [31](https://bit.ly/2VwMvfu)

**Corticosteroids should be avoided** unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

* Fever and signs/symptoms of a lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization **AND** A history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR

* Fever with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS) requiring hospitalization and without alternative explanatory diagnosis (e.g., influenza) **AND** *No source of exposure has been identified*

**How to test:** Healthcare providers should immediately notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a COVID-19 PUI case investigation form available below.

Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).

While most numbers are similar in Table 1 for - it shows Remdesivir vs placebo (541 vs 522) having 125 vs 147 patients receiving ""invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO"".

Since we know most such patients die, this is an advantage of 22 patients more in the placebo - if nearly all of them died, that is a 4 percent disadvantage to the placebo, which may wash out the seeming advantage for Remdesivir they have shown in the Results:

>The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo

In Figure 2 they show the graphs for the sub-groups - and for  ""invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO"" the graphs seems close - if we rebalance to remove the 22 extra severe patients in the placebo arm, will it make the Remdesivir curve even worse?

For the other sub-groups like non-invasive ventilation etc., Remdesivir may show an advantage, and it may be useful if given early (as generally antivirals should be).

#### Abstract

We examined the effect of intact human mast cells (HMC-1 5C6) and their selected mediators on interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Scanning electron microscopy showed that HMC-1 5C6 cells adhere to HCAEC in cocultures. Addition of HMC-1 5C6 cells markedly enhanced the IL-6 production by quiescent and LPS-activated HCAEC even at the maximal concentration of LPS. Furthermore, mast cell-derived histamine and proteases accounted for the direct and synergistic effect of mast cells on IL-6 production that was completely blocked by the combination of histamine receptor-1 antagonist and protease inhibitors. Another novel finding is that histamine was able to induce BMP-2 expression in HCAEC. Collectively, our results suggest that endotoxin and mast cell products synergistically amplify vascular inflammation and that histamine participates in the early events of vascular calcification.

#### 1. Introduction

Mast cells are normal constituents of the vessel wall and are primarily located in the connective tissue matrices. Increasing evidence suggests an important role for mast cells in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis \[1–4\], fibrosis \[5\], osteoporosis \[6\], and host defense \[7\]. The adventitia of coronary arteries of patients with atherosclerotic plaques contains increased number of mast cells \[1–3, 8–10\]. An increase in the number of tissue mast cells is also found to be associated with thrombus formation \[3\]. Mast cell granules have been identified within endothelial cells *in vivo* \[11\] and are known to cause proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells \[12\]. Furthermore, mast cell granule remnants can bind to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and enhance their uptake by macrophages leading to the development of foam cells \[13, 14\]. We have previously shown that granules isolated from rat peritoneal mast cells interact with human endothelial cells in culture and enhance lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 \[15–17\]. These findings suggest that mast cells play an important role in endothelial cell activation and vascular inflammation. However, the interaction of human mast cells with human endothelial cells and its impact on inflammatory responses has not been evaluated.

Vascular endothelium regulates many aspects of the inflammatory response in addition to its well-recognized function as a protective barrier between blood and tissues. Activation of endothelial cells and resultant enhancement in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, prostanoids, and the expression of adhesion molecules are critical factors for the immune response and host defense as well as for the progression of inflammatory diseases. The cascade of endothelial activation can be initiated by both endogenous agonists such as inflammatory cytokines, lipid mediators, histamine, and proteases, and by exogenous agents including microbial agents. We have shown that the cell wall components of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can induce inflammatory responses in human endothelial cells \[15–18\] suggesting an important role for infectious agents in initiating vascular inflammation.

Mast cells synthesize and secrete many vasoactive substances and inflammatory mediators including histamine, proteases (tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase A) prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, heparin, and cytokines \[19–23\]. Histamine and tryptase are two major secretory products of mast cells. The involvement of histamine in vascular disease is suggested by its elevated levels in the coronary circulation of patients with variant angina \[24\] and an increased expression of histamine H1receptor (H1R) in atherosclerotic lesions \[25\]. Previous reports from our laboratory show that histamine induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6 mRNA and the production of PGI2, PGE2, and IL-6 \[18, 26, 27\]. A number of reports have also documented the role of mast cells in the formation of foam cells \[13, 14\] and calcification of plaques \[9, 10\]. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2**)** is a key molecule in the calcification cascade and its expression in endothelial cells is induced by TNF-*α* or by mechanical stimuli \[28, 29\]. Although mast cells are involved in atherosclerotic plaque development \[9, 10\], direct effect of mast cell components on the expression of BMP-2 has not been explored. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of intact human mast cells and their products on the regulation of inflammatory and calcification responses in naïve and LPS-activated HCAEC.

#### 2. Materials and Methods

##### 2.1. Cells

Human coronary artery endothelial cells and endothelial cell growth medium (EGM-2MV) were obtained from Cambrex (San Diego, CA). Human mast cell line, subclone HMC-1 5C6 (derived from HMC-1 cells) was kindly provided by Dr. Michel Arock (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan, Cachan, France).

##### 2.2. Culture of Endothelial Cells

HCAEC were grown in EGM-2MV containing 1 *μ*g/mL hydrocortisone acetate, 50 ng/mL gentamycin, 50 *μ*g/mL amphotericin B, and the recommended concentrations of human epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, human fibroblast growth factor, recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, and 5% fetal bovine serum as described previously \[15, 16\]. At confluence, cells were detached from the culture flasks using trypsin-EDTA, washed twice, and resuspended in fresh EGM-2MV. The cells used in all experiments were between passages three and six.

##### 2.3. Mast Cells

HMC-1 5C6 cells were grown in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 10% FBS and 50 *μ*M of 2-mercaptoethanol at 37°C and 5% CO2. When applicable, mast cells were pretreated overnight with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo) containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride 1 mM, bestatin 40 *μ*M, E-64 14 *μ*M, leupeptin 20 *μ*M, pepstatin 15 *μ*M, and aprotinin 0.8 *μ*M. Protease inhibitor-treated mast cells were incubated with HCAEC and washed twice with EGM-2MV. Mast cells treated with EGM-2MV containing 1% DMSO were used as controls since DMSO was used as the vehicle to resuspend the protease inhibitor cocktail.

##### 2.4. Determination of IL-6 Production

HCAEC were seeded onto 96-well cell culture plate (1 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 16 to 18 h. Following adherence, endothelial cell monolayers were incubated with mast cells or lysates derived from equivalent counts of mast cells in the presence or absence of LPS in a final volume of 0.2 mL at 37°C under 5% humidified CO2. After the indicated incubation period, culture supernatants were harvested, appropriately diluted, and assayed for IL-6 levels by ELISA \[16–18\].

#### 3. Results

In order to examine the effect of human mast cells, we compared the direct and synergistic effects of HMC-1 5C6 on IL-6 production by HCAEC.

##### 3.1. Effect of HMC-1 5C6 on IL-6 Production by HCAEC Stimulated with LPS

The effects of HMC-1 5C6 on IL-6 production by unactivated or LPS-treated HCAEC are presented in Figure [1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2012/274347/fig1/). Unactivated HCAEC produced relatively low levels of IL-6 in a 24 h culture. However, LPS stimulated the production of IL-6 by HCAEC in a dose-dependent manner which attained a plateau at 100 ng/mL LPS. Presence of HMC-1 5C6 in the coculture, at an endothelial cell: mast cell ratio of 1 : 1 resulted in a marked potentiation of LPS-induced IL-6 production at all concentrations of LPS tested. It is of interest that mast cells alone induced a small but significant increase in IL-6 production by HCAEC. The amplification of LPS-induced cytokine production by HMC-1 5C6 was evident at LPS concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/mL and at higher doses (100 and 1000 ng/mL LPS). Once again, increased levels of IL-6 cannot be attributed to the IL-6 production by HMC-1 5C6 because these cells did not generate detectable amounts of IL-6 in the presence or absence of LPS (data not shown).

[Professor Chris Whitty](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/christopher-whitty) said the social cost of the virus may include primaries, secondaries, colleges and universities up and down the country shutting their doors for more than two months. He was speaking as it was confirmed that the UK now has 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – the first case in Northern Ireland.

Professor Whitty told the Nuffield Trust summit: ‘One of the things that’s really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we’re going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months.’


Sports events and concerts may have to be cancelled and schools closed for more than two months if the UK is hit by a global pandemic of coronavirus, the chief medical officer has warned.


World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Thursday that coronavirus has the potential to become a global pandemic but this stage had not been reached.

Senior doctors from hospitals across England have said that the NHS “would crumble” if the number of those infected reaches pandemic levels.

The situation would mean doctors having to make “tough decisions” in order to free up beds.


Ministers are finalising the government’s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. [Matt Hancock](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/matthew-hancock), the health secretary, insisted: “There is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That’s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.”

Once the deaths are detected you are a couple weeks away from something like 10,000 cases and a month away from truly scary numbers.

That is if the deaths are detected. But at some point very quickly it will be obvious that people are dying.

So this is true to an extent but as soon as you pick it up you are already in trouble.

I can't tell from looking at the paper what the threshold would be. Could they detect a 1-2 thousand extra cases (keep in mind this would probably manifest as only a few hundred because a lot of people will not go to the doctor for a 'flu').

To be honest this is expected and why the cases were not detected in the other developed countries until someone went to the hospital in bad shape with deaths following soon after. In Iran the first indication seems to be deaths.

I'm rusty on my population genetics analysis but I think I understood what was essentially done to create this binary distinction.

They used linkage analysis, which is normally used in the context of recombining chromosomes in sexually reproducing eukaryotes. What the underlying mechanisms are in the case of an asexually reproducing virus to make this a valid approach are currently beyond my understanding.

I'll assume there's something to it, then. But delving deeper this study of linkage just seems like a very coarse grained and pre-genomics way of creating a phylogeny.

We can make phylogenies with full sequencing and computational techniques. It's a very well described optimization exercise to find parsimony. And it gives us trees like the ones on www.nextstrain.org/ncov

Look at the phylogenetic tree with 164 genomes (and counting) and explain to me where it makes sense to split it into exactly two pieces. It doesn't matter how they decided to make this distinction, in the end that's what they're basically doing. Am I misunderstanding something here?

The most dubious part of the article was the sheer amount of hand waving in the discussion to convince the reader of their particular branch of the tree being critical. Literally comparing different numbers of genomes that fall into one category or the other. They assume that every genome is part of a representative and random sample of genomes when it most certainly isn't at this stage. Most genomes come from very few areas (even fewer when this was written) because the world is not systematically testing at anywhere near what they should. I don't even want to bother with the confusion of what they mean by one being ""more aggressive"". They don't even know what that means.

Now people are taking the ball and running with it, saying now that we have two distinct ""strains"" that ""re-infection"" is now possible. This basically opens the floodgates to all kinds of ultimately rootless speculation.

Just look at this telegraph article headline https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2020/03/04/coronavirus-has-mutated-aggressive-disease-say-scientists/
