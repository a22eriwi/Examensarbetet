She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily. 

Fast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said ""OK boomer"" and hung up.

I've never been so proud.

A lot of sex between people ocurr here and cheating and affairs and many gossiping. My prom is full of toxic snakes and I hate them profoundly:). Drugs haven’t being a thing but I know weed is around constantly and getting booze into school also. Additionally they make road trips (the prom) to a summer house of someone and that becomes like a sex and drugs weekend. And yes it’s real, no I don’t participate because I dislike it. I used to be a popular girl but the bad kind, until I realized I was an asshole. Now, I’m very glad I didn’t become them. :) ps: I wrote letters to my crush, 28 to be exactly and well we date.

While my school waa still open, some grade 9-10s cornered me and my friend, and gut punched us, kicked us, spit on us, slapped us, then ran. I was pretty hurt, but my friend was stronger than me, and sucked it up pretty quickly. All the school did was ask if I knew who did it, and then just made an announcement, saying racism is bad, and that's that. 

I've also had death threats made at me, water thrown on me, and been spat on. A LOT. Luckily, I always washed it of thoroughly with hot water and soap.

This god-awful racism isn't the answer to the virus cure. Beating up Asians won't do anything! Please, spread the word, MOST Asians only want peace, not violence, excluding the Chinese and North Korean government.

895,g8ku2x,False,Other,1548,I fucked up by using acne medicine instead of lotion while masturbating,teenagers,"Fuck me.

This fuck up occurred one month ago, and I will remember it for the rest of my life.

On one particular night, I was feeling VERY horny. My PP was definitely not coming down any time soon, so I decided I should jack off and call it a night. I draw my pink headed warrior, my spear of impregnation, my magic wand. I’ve always been particularly fond of my genitalia.

My friend had told me once that using lotion can make masturbating feel 10x better, so I said ”*hey, why not*?” and go to my bathroom. I scan the room for lotion, and my eyes fall upon a white bottle with a pump on the top. There it is! I pick it up and bring it back to my room.

I laid down in bed and pumped a small amount of the substance into my dominant hand and spread it around on my weewee, much like spreading cream cheese on a nice piece of toast. **Damn, that felt so good**. My hand could stroke so much faster. I pumped myself a handful of the sweet lotion and applied it to the pp.

I stroked harder and harder and harder. I kept thinking about my GF’s pair while doing so. These to aspects in combination led to the sweetest orgasm I’d had in a while.

There was no need to wash the lotion-like substance off, because it had been completely rubbed into my PP. God, what a mistake. Feeling satisfied, I lay down on my pillow thinking about seeing my beautiful girl again, and go to sleep.

I woke the next day at exactly 9:24 AM.

I remember my eyes shooting open.

**My dick was on fire**.

I shit you not, it felt as though a small supernova had been unleashed upon my meat scepter. I screamed and fell out of my bed. I pull my pants and and underwear out of the way to see what was stimulating such agony in my penis.

I will not describe what I saw.

All I will say is that it was something you’d see in a horror movie. Plain and simple. Pure hell released upon my once glorious dong.

I muster whatever remaining strength there was in my legs, and sprinted to the bathroom.

I turn on the faucet and set it to the coolest setting. When I put my dick under the cool jets of water, I let out a whimper. God, I wanted to take a greatsword and just cut it off. I bite my lip while tears roll down my cheek.

I look at the lotion bottle I had used last night. I check the label to see if it had Shea butter, something I’m allergic to. One word caught my eye: acne. I gasp in horror. I turn the bottle, to be met with the words **acne medication**.

A medication which is designed to dry up skin and to be used in small amounts.

**And I had rubbed an entire handful of it into my penis.**

I let out a scream, this one louder than the first. My dick was in absolutely agonizing pain. But then, in my self induced shock, I have a faint memory. I had recently been struggling with dry skin on my face, and had been handling it by using a special cream.

”*It just might work*” I mutter to myself. I grab the cream and begin rubbing it over my now numb penis. Instant pain, but also a feeling of relief. Tears of pain and frustration are falling, but I don’t stop. I continue this process for the next hour locked in the bathroom. Every hour or so, I rubbed a bit more into my penis. My mom would occasionally ask *”is everything ok honey?”* to which I would halfheartedly tell her that I love her.

Over the next two days, my dick had completely healed. It was a painful recovery, but I had done it.

**TL;DR**: I was feeling horny, so I decided to use what looked like lotion to help masturbate. Little did I know, it was actually acne medicine. This proceeded to fuck up my penis.

Fuck me, hopefully you got a laugh out of my stupidity.

627,exk4v7,False,Advice,1414,"Well r/teenagers, it’s been a fun ride. After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here’s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13)",teenagers,"1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they’re young or old. *This is okay.*

2. It’s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won’t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.

3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.

4. That doesn’t mean resist what you want to do because it’s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don’t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It’ll be hilarious later.

5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It’s okay to be nervous, just don’t be weird.

6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck’s sake, don’t seem like you’re desperate.

7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You’re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you’ll have someone to talk about it with)

8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you’re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.

9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you’re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.

10. In a few years. you’re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you’re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.

11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.

12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.

13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I’ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.

14. Join clubs. If you don’t like them, don’t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.

15. If you’re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**

16. If you’re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**

17. If you’re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.

18. That doesn’t mean “get all ‘C’s and work at McDonalds”. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.

19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you’re the guy/girl with a ride, it’s super easy to cement yourself as the “pack leader” for your friend group. Plus it’s going to set you up for success after you graduate.

20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don’t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You’re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won’t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have. Use it wisely.

And with that, r/teenagers, I bid you farewell. I hope you all have an excellent 6 years of confusion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/exk4v7/well_rteenagers_its_been_a_fun_ride_after_today_i/,41228,Well number was is wrong so I can assume the rest are too.

Moving forward to 7th grade, I was moving out of America and the kid was in the same class as me still. He was absent because of a really major seizure. On my final day of school, his mom came in and called my name. The kid literally gifted me a 20 dollar silver mechanical pencil just because I lended him a wooden pencil. Until this day, I have the box of the pencil on the desk of my room, and I wish to meet that kid again.

939,hojv83,False,Advice,2682,Things girls actually care about,teenagers,"Before reading please consider this is not meant to take 100% literally. This is a generalization. Some points may not apply to you, and others may be cultural. It extremely important to main the niceness of your cock and to take everything with a grain of salt. 


The amount of “I’m lonely, I need to be in a relationship” posts are insane so I decided to put together a small little list. 

1. Basic hygiene. I think that most guys under estimate how much of an impact just not smelling like a sweat ball can make. The opposite is also true. Please do not smell like the inside of a can of axe. 

2. Ability to take care of yourself.  By this I mean you don’t have to have a six pack by any means, just show that you care about yourself. It can even be as simple as just having some sort of outlet wether that be athletic or artistic, or even just dressing semi nicely (doesn’t mean expensively), it doesn’t really matter. It’s pretty obvious, if you can’t take care of yourself, there’s no way you’re ready for a relationship. 

3. Being authentic with a personality. It’s so easy to see when someone’s genuinely happy vs when they’re just trying to fit in. Be yourself, and be confident. If nothing else, be confident that you are yourself.  If you aren’t confident, just fake it till you make it. Ask yourself, “if the most confident person in the world was here, in my shoes, what would they do?”, then just do that regardless of how hard it may be. Also having a personality goes along ways. Don’t be different just for the sake of being different, but at the same time, be unique, be you. 

4. Treating us like normal human beings.  We are not sex objects, and thus should not be treated as such (I’m a bad example of this lol). This isn’t some third wave feminism bullshit, it’s just about basic levels of respect. Being female doesn’t make us superior or inferior, we are just as anxious, awkward and uncomfortable as you guys (I think so anyways). Being able just talk to us normally goes a long ways. 

5. Not pushing things TOO far. For better or worse girls will almost never make the first move, it’s almost a pride thing if I’m being honest, but we will drop hints ([this comment contains further information regarding the different ways that “hints” are generally displayed](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hojv83/things_girls_actually_care_about/fxicxss/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)). Generally if we haven’t made it abundantly clear you’re friend zoned, you haven’t been. In that regard don’t befriend a girl in hopes of perusing a relationship. It’s like asking to be friend zoned then getting annoyed that you get friend zoned, no one wins ([check out this comment which inspired this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hojv83/things_girls_actually_care_about/fxip0wp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) ).  Also please respect their decision. If you ask and we say no, it’s not changing, but honestly 9/10 times it’s a yes.  



No goes:

- smelly (ew)

- Self loathing (be confident)

- Don’t try to be someone you aren’t

- Self entitlement 

- Egotistical. There’s sort of a grey area on this one and comes down to personal preference, but in general being self confident is a great thing, but being overly so can be an instant no go. 


Bonus points:

- If you are good with either children kids or pets (will melt our hearts)

- Having a sense of humour goes a long way in having a good personality. 

- Being self aware of your flaws, but not overly self conscious 

- When complimenting be specific. Say something about her that is only relevant to her. It just shows that you actually care about her. 

- Ability to communicate in general and be open emotionally (emotional maturity). The strong silent type might work for some, but 9 times out of 10 it comes across as being completely emotionally immature (which by the way is also a no go)

- Not complaining when we inevitably start taking your clothes



That all being said, I’d be lying if I said looks had nothing to do with it. We all LIKE the body, generally it’s the person we fall in LOVE with. For all you gamer guys it’s like an RTX 2060 with built in RGB vs an RTX 2080ti without RGB. It’s what’s underneath that we actually appreciate.  



I love you, have a fantastic day.  
Also sorry for shitty formatting, on mobile :)

322,axf7kt,False,Discussion,2494,To the teenager who came into my shop today with your mom,teenagers,"Your mom came in today asking for my help to invade your private life. She even brought you with her. I can’t imagine how embarrassing that must be. 

She asked me to go through your phone and computer and find any apps or photos that she wouldn’t approve of, because she was too technology illiterate to do it herself, all the while making you watch. (I work at a tech support shop) 

Personally I think this is an invasion of your personal space and privacy. 

So when I found the folder where you’d hid all your movies and games, I made sure to pretend I didn’t see them. 

On your phone, I told her that you didn’t have anything but the default apps and angry birds. 

And then, I showed her a place where she could look on your phone that would only show her the default apps, not the ones you downloaded. So hopefully when she invaded your space again, she won’t find anything. 

Was I wrong to do what I did? Probably. But you’re only a year or two away from adulthood and I don’t think it’s right that anyone be that intrusive, mother or not. 

Good luck in life man. Hope things get better for you soon. 


Edit: Thanks for the shiny medals! I’ll be sure to take good care of them. 

Also, way too many comments to keep up with, but I’ll try to read them all and respond :)

259,amhkb9,False,Serious,3854,ATTENTION ALL TEENAGERS: This sub is an early breeding ground for future INCELS and we should work to prevent it.,teenagers,"Greetings,

I've been a pretty long time reader of this sub. I have noticed a lot of posts along the lines of ""I just asked my crush out"" etc. 

Those posts are totally fine. We all like the comradery and supporting a fellow peer; however, its the comments and some of the other posts that breed this incel culture.

From the front page of this subreddit today:

 [I'm having a date with my crush in about 3 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amcok2/im_having_a_date_with_my_crush_in_about_3_hours/)

>Jesus lucky bastard

>You lucky shit! 

>Thanks, although I don't think much will change. Rn I'm just lying in bed watching anime like the lazy piece of shit I am.

>Tell us if you bang her

>I've always become friends with my crushes... just friends...

>You lucky piece of shit....

The ""lucky"" comments seem to insinuate two things. First, that love and happiness is based on luck, and that these commentors are just unlucky and won't even find love. Second, there is a bit of bitterness and disdain toward the ""lucky"" person. Kind of like saying, ""Why this fucker and not me!!!!"" Additionally, this thread also had some pretty incel-specific comments (3rd and 6th). Some of the responses to those comments were along the lines of, ""oh don't worry it gets better you just need to wait it out"". NO! That is the worst thing you can tell someone in that situation! More on that later.

[Anyone else feel heartbroken despite never having had a girlfriend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amdkvp/anyone_else_feel_heartbroken_despite_never_having/) - **200 upvotes**

>At least you got offers

>Yep, except I didn't had any offer...

This post was pretty good overall. A lot of the other comments were supportive.

>I know how fustrating it can be trust me. But you are feeling this way because you're focusing too much on the fact that someone might turn up and then they don't. You shouldn't let wanting a relationship affect how you act or do work, otherwise you'll fall into a depression

We should take the example of this guy above. When you see someone posting stuff like this, work to counteract it. Don't let your friends on this sub fall into this incel-ish mentality. They may not be a full incel yet, but these types of feeling are what create one in the future.

**Those two posts are just examples from today. There are many more out there. PLEASE BOIS, when you see a friend display incel tenancies, try to snap them out of it!**

*If you are an incel or pre-incel reading this post, here are some suggestions to snap out of it:*

- You can't just sit idle and ""wait for life to get better""! You have to get out and do something. Make something. BE SOMETHING. Sitting idle and waiting just allows someone to perpetuate their own grievances and get mad at the world that ""life is not getting better for me"". If you want your life to get better, you have to pull yourself up by your bootsraps and tell yourself ""I want to change"".

- Work out (strength, cardio, whatever). I can't tell you how amazing you will feel once you begin getting some exercise. It is almost like a drug, it's that good. 

- Bathe. You will feel good once you're clean.

- Talk to people in person. It's not as weird as you think to just randomly just start talking to someone (men or women).

- Stop doing drugs if you do them.

- Cut out the porn. You'll begin to see women as real people instead of sex objects. 

Thanks for reading.

**THE ONE AND ONLY EDIT:**

Quoting one of the replies:

>Why does no one see the point of this post. The point of this post wasn’t to call out kids who are depressed about not being in a relationship. The whole point was to just let people know about how incel behavior, given the right conditions, can manifest itself in teens as they grow older

>If this post prevents one depressed kid from becoming an incel in any way, then it’s done it’s job.

What this person said above is true. I've had numerous people PM me and say how they are going to improve themselves and turn themselves around. WONDERFUL! I'm glad this post accomplished something. A lot of the replies to his thread are completely disgusting. Not to mention the replies that perfectly exhibit the behavior I am trying to point out in this post.

Thanks to those that were able to have a civilized discussion.

I put exactly ZERO effort into making this post, and I've just exploited all of your stress to get useless internet numbers.

It all started in first grade gym class. We had a little course set up and you could go fuck around freely   at the end of the lesson. 

They had some ropes hanging from the ceiling that you could climb or swing on. I was climbing and slipped a little so I grabbed the rope tightly and straightened my legs to press the rope between my thighs. At that point what happened was very confusing to a 7 year old retard. I pissed my pants (witch later turned out to be cum) and slid down the rope mid-orgasm. I told my friend to climb the magic nut-rope, but he didn't believe. 

I still to this day wonder how my underdeveloped limp penis managed to crank one out.

Yes. Due to a certain asshole, I know some people won’t believe me, so I will attach photos of me. They  are taken off my parents Facebook. Also, due to phobias of being doxxed, if you want to see them please send me a message over DMs. I will send a dm with a link to see them. They will be slightly edited so  they cannot be traced back to me, but due to the amount of photos (and a modern day photo for you to compare too) I am hoping that it will be enough to prove that it is real. The imugur links no longer work. It is 11:30pm where I am, and I may stop responding soon, as it’s late. If I do go offline, I will be back to send DMs tomorrow sometime. 

You know what, screw it. Here is the Instagram. This post was deleted for weird reasons. If you wanna see the pics add me and in the morning (or afternoon- whenever I wake up) I will let you see them. It’s a private account. You won’t be able to see them before hand. I’m tired, it’s 12:28am and I don’t want people doubting me anymore [Instagram made for this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCPKqcTlo4ZLx-Shp6BB0tSzdB2S24v_mtBNag0/?igshid=1c9zkjo3pk32d). Goodnight. Love you all

March 28th 2017, a Tuesday. Diagnosed around 9:45pm

I was rushed to the hospital that day. I had blood taken, but my leukaemia was so bad, that the leukaemia made my spleen and liver swell, and push  up against my liver. I couldn’t eat. They could tell I had some sort of cancer after a 10 minute checkup.
[here is a photo of me that night, aged 12](https://imgur.com/gallery/LdPdoqV)

I begin treatment. I’m moved to a specialised hospital. I began 2 years and 4 months of chemotherapy. 

It was hard and sucked ass.

But on the 3rd of July, I took my last meds.

On the 4th july, I was officially signed off and rang my bell. I’m so excited and had to share it. I know you are all strangers but I kinda just want to tell the world. I wanna shout it out. I’m alive! I am proud. And I am happy. 

So whilst everyone eats hotdogs and watches the fireworks, I’ll be celebrating from the uk. Thanks dudes. :)

[fat me ringing the bell this time last year](https://imgur.com/gallery/S3oxcA1)

I will now input several pictures of me, just for proof. Gonna do this as that loser faked having cancer.

Also, if anyone wants to ask me questions, it may take me a while (I’m celebrating with my sisters) but I will try and get back to you guys. :))

Also, if anyone is still looking a this post (thanks) but I would like to mention a couple of charities which helped me, and won’t give away my location and address

Make a wish and CLIC saergent. If you can, please use the DreamLab app (it’s free). Or donate to a cause that means a lot to you. Donate to something you are passionate about, if you can afford to and want to. I don’t want awards. (Though I am genuinely really happy and thankful for anyone who even thought about giving me one). 

Even though I know That I’m real and I’m not faking and I’m just sharing something I’m proud of to the whole world, you can’t guarantee I’m real. That’s one thing that [redacted] taught us.

Enjoy your evenings. Love you all. :)

Edit 2: Hey guys, due to this post blowing up, and people being able to find my identity by reverse image searching, I am hiding all the images of myself. If anyone wants to see proof, I will send the photos to you privately. I’m sorry, I’m just getting a bit sick with worry that someone might do that. Thank you for understanding.
