921,grpawu,False,,73,What are the pros and cons of basing eligibility for social security on life expectancy?,NeutralPolitics,"Current SS benefits eligibility starts at 62, with greater amounts if you don't take until later. In it's current form, many individuals may be getting the short end of the stick in social security by never reaping benefits or reaping it for much fewer years than average. Conversely, some people may get benefits for 40+ years. These discrepancies can be seen not just individually but also in demographics when broken down by race and gender:

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf - White and hispanic women live about a decade longer than black men

http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/412943-Has-Social-Security-Redistributed-to-Whites-from-People-of-Color-.PDF - Money is being distributed from PoC to whites

https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v62n2/v62n2p59.pdf - ""Minorities and Social Security: An Analysis of Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Current Program""

These individual and demographic discrepancies could be mitigated by attributing life expectancy (as in years left to live, not as in expected age of death) as triggers for social security benefits, or taken into consideration along with age for social security eligibility. Here is a table of life expectancy for Americans based on age and sex, for an example of what I mean (much more than age and sex could be taken into consideration): https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html

417,bvlsua,False,,99,Why does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?,NeutralPolitics,"Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](
https://augustafreepress.com/lieutenant-governor-northam-casts-tiebreaking-vote-end-employment-discrimination-state-government/)

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. 

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? 

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. 

So as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.

It seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. 

I know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -

1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

Is there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here? Or like I suggested earlier, is this simply being done for symbolic purposes?

""Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).""

While the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why

[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.

Additionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.

The ""zero tolerance"" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that ""[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/).

On the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because ""the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held"", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested.

I use evil here instead of naming certain parties to keep this neutral. Evil being the opposite party you don't want to win.

So for example, if Trump is Republican candidate, Hillary is Democratic, it wouldn't serve Hillary's campaign (or liberals) for Bernie to run independent because in the event of a statistical tie, the House would vote for Trump. However, if someone like Bloomberg ran independent, the vote tied, the house would choose Bloomberg or Trump.  It won't help Hillary for a third party candidate who can draw real votes to run in this election.  Best case scenario for Hillary would be to get a crazy-strong VP (normally VP's don't determine campaigns but if they're really strong and well known do drive voters, i.e. Bernie's voters, this could make Hillary's campaign stronger and bring out the vote).

148,8u152w,False,,97,"What happens now with the ""Travel Ban""?",NeutralPolitics,"Today, [SCOTUS ruled 5-4 that the Trump has constitutional authority to implement his ""Travel Ban""](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf).

So my questions are pretty simple: What happens now?

If we read the text of the [current ""Travel Ban""](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states-2/), which was issued in March of 2017, there are several key things I'd like to inquire about.

The first is the statement that such a travel ban will last only 90-days:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Does the 90-day period begin now, or how does that work? Also, is it enforced by law or is the 90-day window an arbitrary number that has no legal bearing?

Lastly, there are several mentions of stipulating factors for this proclamation, specifically surrounding our (The United States) ""review"" of several processes. Examples:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, **while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review**, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

> Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP **pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees.** Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Since these statements, to me, imply that this ban will continue as long as our processes are under review, is there anything that legally obligates the government to conduct an actual review of their processes *and finish it*, or could they theoretically conduct a review for four years?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8u152w/what_happens_now_with_the_travel_ban/,787,"Should it not  be moot, since it should have expired 90 days after it was enacted so that ""we can figure out what the hell is going on?""

- Potentially makes the judiciary more efficient by reducing the number of cases

- It's hard to enforce and somewhat inefficient to enforce. Before the bill, judges would make this determination now I guess the judge has to tell the police and provide a basis for their claim. It would be hard for routine law enforcement to recognize what a ""frivolous claim"" is, especially with how pleadings work where changing one word or paragraph in the complaint can substantially change the course of the lawsuit. 

Quick thoughts on [HR 985](https://policy.house.gov/legislative/bills/hr-985-fairness-class-action-litigation-act-2017):

- Seems to tighten the requirements to qualify as a ""class"" for a class action lawsuit. Probably will make it a little harder to develop a ""class"" as a whole

- Happy lawyers for class action lawsuits get paid only after all members have been paid. Opens the door for issues surrounding how payments are structured though.

815,92v2k7,False,,89,What are the pros and cons of continuing austerity programs (e.g. Greece)?,NeutralPolitics,"This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).

This week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:

>Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.

>“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”

**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).

Austerity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.

The evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:

>However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:

>•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­

>•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­

>•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­

There are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.

[""**European policymakers struggle to achieve two main goals: safeguarding the idea that the euro is irreversible and stable; and protecting their own banks and taxpayer money**.

There is a hostile atmosphere and censorship, in addition with bad and sometimes insulting behavior from the user and moderator team and being aggressive and insulting towards people with not leftist viewpoints, and this definetly harms discussion.

Propaganda that claims to be about evidence, facts, logic, respect or neutrality might be easier to swallow, so I see this subreddit as particularly sinister.

> He has charged that some of his adversaries are guilty of treason, and he was asked Thursday to provide the names of people who should be held accountable for a crime punishable by death.

> “We certainly expect the people that were responsible and that were part of this unprecedented obstruction and corruption at the FBI, those people should certainly be held responsible and be held accountable,” added Sanders. “And the president expects that to take place.”

- Is there currently any evidence that Comey has broken the law?
- Are there any historical examples of an FBI employee being charged for the way/process an investigation was opened?
- How do historical cases of treason charges compare to this situation?

Burqa bans, for the purposes of this question, include the legislation in France banning the wearing of face coverings in public(It's hard to find the text in english, but [this source](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/france-law-prohibiting-the-wearing-of-clothing-concealing-ones-face-in-public-spaces-found-constitutional/) gives ""The law reviewed by the Constitutional Council provides that 'no one, in a public space, may wear clothing intended to conceal the face.'""), the potential ban in Denmark that is not written yet, but seems to be along the lines of the French one and any other legislation in western countries that has had similar effect(most burqa bans seem to be part of larger public face-covering bans). 

The most stated popular reasonings behind the ban appear to be [social cohesion, or protecting women's rights](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/europe/burqa-burkini-bans/index.html) and [security, or the suppression of radical islam](http://www.newsweek.com/burqa-ban-european-peoples-party-france-582312), though some wearers of the garments say the problems are being made up.

So, before bans were put in place [around 2010-11](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/headscarves-and-muslim-veil-ban-debate-timeline), was there any reason to believe that the bans would result in greater social cohesion, security, or women's rights?

88,7utdei,False,,768,"Nunes Memo: What is true, what is misleading? What is new, what was previously known? And what are potential consequences for the investigations into Russian election meddling?",NeutralPolitics,"Hi folks,

I'd like to break down the memo away from the major political subreddit megathreads a bit. [The memo can be read from this  Scribd link.](https://www.scribd.com/document/370599381/Nunes-Memo)

With all the speculation bouncing around prior to the release of the memo, it has become difficult to separate what was known vs speculated on regarding the memo and to what degree. I'd like to sort that out to some degree.

I'd also like to sort out where material presented in the memo changes the picture of the ongoing investigations, and where the memo may be misleading. Four possible starting points are: (1) the timing of surveillance on Carter Page, (2) the role of Bruce Ohr in the investigations, (3) the relationship to the Papadopoulos investigation, and (4) the necessity of the Steele dossier to the investigation. I'd love to discuss any other points as well.

Regarding (1), we've heard previously that [Page was under FISA surveillance since 2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576), but I'm not sure where that info comes from (the above has no corroboration in the link). Is the application mentioned in the memo a continuation or a new warrant? If a continuation, wouldn't that make the memo's assertions about the necessity of the Steele dossier misleading? If a new warrant, was he being surveilled earlier? And why was this a new warrant, not a continuation?

Regarding (2), Steele is said to have contacted DoJ through Bruce Ohr. Do we have any additional info on this contact? Was he Steele's only DoJ contact or were there others? What is Ohr's role now? How much do potential conflicts-of-interest regarding Ohr's wife and the DNC matter?

Regarding (3), the Papadopoulos info provided doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the memo's narrative. The memo states the investigation into Papadopoulos began in July 2016, but the FISA warrant for Page didn't begin until October. Is info on Papadopoulos in the dossier, and was the dossier used to begin that investigation? I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here; it seems to me to be another chance to bring up Strzok's name more than anything else, but I'm open to discussion.

Regarding (4), do we have corroboration that McCabe stated the investigation into Page required the dossier information? If true, that might make the FISA warrant originally issud questionable, [or it might not](https://lawfareblog.com/dubious-legal-claim-behind-releasethememo) as discussed in this lawfareblog post from before the public release of the memo. Essentially, the post states that bias in the evidence used to obtain the warrant is not enough to stop the warrant from being issued if the biased information is precise and from a reliable source.

That's just to get a discussion started - I'm hoping to break down the memo some more and draw connections to info we had before the release of the memo as well.

Following President Trump's [private meeting](https://apnews.com/afd7db4f7c024a678c696da68edd15ce) with Putin in Helsinki, [Senate Democrats expressed concerns](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/19/helsinki-summit-democrats-want-hear-trumps-interpreter/799733002/) about the meeting and requested the interpreter testify before them in a closed session so they could ascertain what, if anything, was agreed to.

Based on this, a few questions arise:

2. Are there ethical complications in doing so?

672,5ojzfs,False,,176,Is drug legalization/decriminalization sound policy?,NeutralPolitics,"California, America's largest state, recently [legalized the recreational use and sale of cannabis](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-64-marijuana-1478281845-htmlstory.html), joining seven other states as American public opinion [moves in favor](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/support-for-marijuana-legalization-continues-to-rise/) of full, national legalization. 

The US and much of the rest of the world have historically cooperated via a [series of international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) to outlaw many recreational drugs, including cannabis, LSD, cocaine and so on. Recent trends in cannabis in the United States and [other nations](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/global-marijuana-cannabis-laws/) have thrown this old equilibrium into question. On top of this, some nations like Portugal have [experimented with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/?utm_term=.1d839e2c929c) decriminalizing all recreational drugs, including ""hard drugs"". 

The connection between narcotic prohibition and crime has long been noted, especially with regards to [terrorists in Afghanistan](http://www.opium.org/how-does-opium-fund-terrorism.html) and [cartels in Mexico](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-cartel-guide-2015-12). Additionally, some have pointed out that many currently illegal drugs are [generally less dangerous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm) than legal ones like alcohol and tobacco. However, many currently prohibited drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, are [highly addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) and have [significant negative health effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/commonly-abused-drugs-charts), perhaps justifying prohibition. 

Is decriminalization and legalization of such recreational drugs sound policy? What positive effects does it have, and what are its drawbacks? Should a line be drawn on legalization between ""hard"" and ""soft"" drugs?

663,5hxwfr,False,,295,What are the pros and cons of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's approach to education reform?,NeutralPolitics,"I’ve been hearing a lot about Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, some of it bad and some of it good. [It seems pretty clear that]( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos) she strongly supports “school choice” – in other words, she is a supporter of scholarship tax credits, vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter schools.
I’ve seen hefty criticism of her approach to public education, and I’ve also seen some praise, as well as some sources that [give a pretty even rundown of both sides of the debate]( http://www.balancedpolitics.org/school_vouchers.htm). [According to what I’ve been able to find] ( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos), the pros of her approach are:

- It will encourage more innovation in schools, helping to move our stagnated public education system forward by creating competition.

- It will give poor families the same opportunity to choose their kids’ education as rich families have.

- Those who attend private schools generally have [higher SAT scores]( http://www.capenet.org/pdf/Outlook399.pdf) than those who attend public schools. However, [others]( http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/comparing-private-public-school-test-scores/) say that once you apply a standardized test such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and adjust it for socioeconomic factors, there is little to no difference between the scores of public and private schools.

- Private schools allow students to attain a greater depth in subjects that interest them.

- Private schools are more effective than public schools at managing their money.

The cons, on the other hand, are:

- Vouchers drain funds from public schools.

- Private schools aren’t monitored as closely as public schools; therefore, there is a risk that some may not provide a fair, balanced, or responsible education.

- Whereas public schools are open to everyone, private schools can discriminate based on a variety of factors. However, I would personally argue that public schools also discriminate in a way, based on income – because public school funding is tied to property values, [lower-income families tend to be stuck with lower-quality schools]( http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem).

- Some, such as the [NY Times]( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html), cite her track record as an example of what will happen if she implements her policies as Secretary of Education. However, the Times also acknowledges that this doesn’t automatically discount the potential of charter schools, citing their success in New Orleans, where rigorous oversight from local leaders ensures that the schools don’t discriminate.

So I’m curious to know your guys’ take on this. What are the pros and cons of her approach to education, and do you think it would ultimately help or hurt the country?

661,8jonuh,False,,41,"[META] Announcing new, more detailed rules guidance.",NeutralPolitics,"After having some issues recently relating to clarity of the rules, we have decided to make a substantial revamp of our rules wiki and adopt detailed explanations for each rule, giving examples and additional information for almost every aspect of them.

None of these explanations are changes to the rules, but they should hopefully codify how we have come to interpret and enforce them over time, and make it easier for users to understand where we're coming from.

---

#Submission rules

A) **Ask a specific political question.** We do not allow overly broad questions, solicitations of pure opinion, surveys, [requests to explain public opinion or media coverage,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/209fox/meta_the_np_community_cannot_explain_public/) posts about other subreddits, or meta posts.
 
 * NeutralPolitics is principally focused on questions of policy and governance.  Analyzing things like media coverage, public opinion and the like are outside of our wheelhouse.
 * A solicitation of pure opinion is a question which can't be answered with facts people could source.

 * For example ""should healthcare be a legal right?"" is a pure opinion question, whereas ""what have been successful and unsuccessful attempts to legally establish positive rights?"" is a question people can answer with facts about what has been done in the past.

 * Questions about ""why"" people do things often run afoul of rule A.  It's very hard to answer a question about motivations with facts, since it's asking our users to read minds.  It's better to ask things like what the stated reasons for a political action are, or who stands to benefit or be harmed by the action.

B) **Frame it in a neutral way.** The post must not be inflammatory, editorialized, leading towards a particular answer, a statement of opinion, or a request to critique your theory.

 * This rule can be tricky to follow, but we've written up some detailed tips [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/)

 * Try to give all sides of a question.  If it's an ongoing issue of debate, link to articles which give multiple perspectives on the question.

 * Do not state things which are highly debated as unequivocally true.  Say (and link) who is asserting their truth and let the source do the arguing in their own name.

 * **Do not answer your own question!** A post which tries to answer the headline question is inherently going to break rule B.

 * Avoid negative framing.* 

  * Instead of asking ""Why don't we do [X policy]?""  ask, What are the pros and cons of [X policy]?""

  * Instead of ""Why doesn't [X politician] do Y?"" ask ""What are the precedents for [an office-holder/candidate] doing Y?""

C) **Outline the issue well.** Give more than just a headline. Provide some background information.

 * This rule is fairly straightforward, but basically it means you should provide enough information so that people understand the context for the question.  News articles or research articles on the subject matter should also be included so there is more background people can read before answering.

D) **Provide sources.** Statements of fact must cite [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Nothing is ""common knowledge."" **Submissions that do not include sources will be rejected.** (Sole exception: if you cannot find specific information after a thorough online search, you may post a request for sources.)

* This rule ensures that submissions are based on factual claims with some outside basis, not just the impressions of the asker.

* If you ""heard"" something, source it.

 * If something is being talked about a lot, it should be easy to find articles talking about it. If you want, you can even modmail us and ask for help with your post. Most of us are news or policy junkies and probably can help you find some good sources.

* Don't attribute a statement to an general group. Name a person who said the thing.

 * Another big issue we get is things like ""people on the right/the left/republicans/democrats/the media"" have been saying X. Often X is an inflammatory/strawman argument.

 * Like things you ""heard about,"" this will not do. NeutralPolitics doesn't do blind quotes. Find an opinion article or something with a named person making that argument. For example:

  * **Bad** ""[X party] has been saying that [Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls.

  * **Good** [Person A], a [X party] member of Congress, said ""[Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls."" [link to source]

* We are much stricter with sources for submissions than for comments.  Please see the [source guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) for more information.

* Requests for sources are rarely allowed, and only when a subject is not easily searched on the internet after substantial effort.  We are not ELI5 or another subreddit for casual questions.  If you are considering such a submission, we strongly suggest [sending us a modmail first.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics&subject=Request%20for%20Sources%20Post&message=)

E) **Propose a good starting point for discussion.** The purpose of this forum is to discuss issues. We do not allow polls, surveys or requests for fact checking.

* This is a close corollary of rule A.  But the gist of it is that we are looking for questions which our users can answer with Reddit comments.

* We are especially strict about this rule when it comes to promoting anything of your own.  We will categorically reject any submission which includes a link to any article or video or other thing which you are the author or creator of.

F) **Title the post accurately.** The title must match the contents.

G) **No requests for speculation.** If the question cannot be answered with facts — which includes any that are phrased in the future tense (What will/would/could happen?) — then it's not appropriate for NeutralPolitics.

* NeutralPolitics is a fact based forum, and questions which ask to predict the future necessarily ask for things which can't be answered with facts.

* Try rephrasing the question to ask what has happened in similar past cases.

* We also prohibit in this category questions whose answer cannot be provided by any user. (e.g. what are the nuclear launch codes; what are the contents of a sealed court case).

* As mentioned with rule A, ""Why"" questions often violate rule G.  They ask our users to speculate about the contents of a person's mind, as opposed to something answerable with facts.

#Comment Rules

1) **Be courteous.** Demeaning language, sarcasm, rudeness or hostility towards another user will get your comment removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

* Our commitment to civil discourse is one of the core principles of NeutralPolitics, and we do not make any exceptions from this rule.

* Any language which a reasonable observer would conclude disparages another user in any way is considered a violation of this rule.  Even if you did not intend that.

* **""But it was true"" is not a defense.**  Accusing another user of something is prohibited, even if you believe that accusation to be true.

* **""They started it"" is not a defense.**  If another user breaks the rules, please report the comment.  Replying with a rule violating comment of your own will just get both of them removed and makes that much more work for the mod team.

2) **Source your facts.** If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up with a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

* This rule is the core of our commitment to fact-based discourse.

* We do not allow claims of expertise or anecdotal evidence to substitute for providing sources.

* We do not allow image sources because they are too easy to manipulate and there's no good way to verify they come from where they purport to.

* We do not allow video sources unless accompanied by text sources because they are too hard for us to moderate and it is unreasonable to ask people to watch a video to check what you're claiming is true.

* Phrasing a statement of fact in the form of a question (""Isn't it true that [X]?"") will be treated as a statement that [X] is true, and needs a source.

* Stating it is your opinion that something is true does not absolve the necessity of sourcing that claim.

* For more detail, read our section on [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources)

3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion-based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

* A NeutralPolitics comment should not just be a general a reaction to the subject matter of the post, but should try to advance a substantive point of some sort backed up by evidence.

* Joke and meme comments are prohibited as not further advancing a productive conversation.

* One-liner comments are prohibited because we want to foster detailed and substantive discussion, and it harms that when people don't put effort into what they're saying.

* Off topic replies are prohibited.  We curate the types of questions we allow under rule A for a reason.

* [Pejorative name calling](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7mn3a5/meta_announcing_a_revised_rule_3_and_a_request/) means any use of a demeaning name to describe a person or group when it's not accompanied by a sourced explanation of why the name is literally accurate.


4) **Address the arguments, not the person.** The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.

* As a part of our commitment to a fact-based discussion, we find that comments which try to go to people's personal motivations or personal conduct are detrimental to our subreddit.

* The subject of discussion on NP is never the conduct or motives of another user, but is always about the substance of what people are saying.  Comments which get personal, even if not directly accusatory or rude, are something which take conversations off topic, and so are banned here.

* The purpose of a discussion is also not to prove another user wrong about something, but rather to inform all readers by using evidence to demonstrate the facts about something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8jonuh/meta_announcing_new_more_detailed_rules_guidance/,379,"Question - why do you allow two month old accounts to mod your sub with full permission?

Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.

Dear users,

Over the last few weeks, a number of posts from this subreddit have hit r/all and/or r/popular.

The appearances in those places have driven considerable traffic to the subreddit and swelled our subscriber numbers, but have also attracted contributors who are not only unaccustomed to our rules, but have no interest in abiding by them. This, in turn, has diminished the quality of discourse in the comments and increased the workload for the mods.

So, although growth has its benefits, we’ve determined that the growth we receive from r/all and r/popular is not the kind that is beneficial to this subreddit, especially with the current state of the larger Reddit culture.

Therefore, as of tomorrow, we will opt out of r/all, and consequently, r/popular. From then on, **if you want to see posts from r/NeutralPolitics on your front page, you’ll have to be subscribed and logged in.**

We do expect this to slow our growth, so if you happen to participate in conversations elsewhere with people you think would appreciate this kind of political discussion environment, feel free to refer them here, because we’re unlikely to attract many subscribers from other avenues after this move.

However, [Mueller said that the president can be indicted after leaving office](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-donald-trump-can-charged-after-leaving-office/1814190001/). And in detailed questioning, [Mueller agreed that all of the three requirements for obstruction charges were met](https://news.yahoo.com/mueller-edges-closer-to-saying-trump-committed-obstruction-160919062.html). Beyond the Mueller case, the president's  former personal lawyer [is currently in prison for crimes that he says the president directed him to commit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/14/michael-cohen-gma-interview-trump/2309268002/), and [new evidence supports the president's involvement in those crimes](https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohen-says-trump-directed-142437206.html). So it seems very likely that a prosecutor could pursue an indictment of the president if not for the DOJ policy, and that policy is valid only as long as the president remains in office. What procedures take effect after that?

In particular,

* How soon can it happen? Even if the prosecutors begin preparing a case in November, as soon as the election result shows that the sitting president is about to leave office, do they have to wait until he formally leaves office in January before they can convene a grand jury to consider an indictment? Or could they be ready to serve an indictment the moment the next president takes the oath of office? Or is every US Attorney obligated by ethics or policy to leave that matter to his or her successor if the incoming president chooses to appoint a new one?
* [Former presidents are guaranteed Secret Service protection for life](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-secret-service-lifetime-protection-bush/1823961/); can the former president direct the Secret Service to block authorities who are trying to execute a lawful arrest warrant? Can anyone else direct the Secret Service to stand down?
* If the former president relocates to a country with no extradition treaty, can he or she keep Secret Service protection there? Or is anyone involved in the relocation potentially guilty of aiding a fugitive?
* [The statute of limitations for some crimes in question requires charges to be filed within five years.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-2020-win-could-run-out-clock-on-obstruction) If the president is re-elected and that clock therefore runs out in his or her second term, can prosecutors still argue that the statute of limitations is suspended (""tolled"") while the president is in office and immune to prosecution? Are there other likely charges with longer statutes of limitations? Might the tolling question be decided differently for state charges instead of federal charges?
* Before he was [pardoned by his successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon), did prosecutors make these kinds of plans to indict former president Richard Nixon?
* What influence does the new president have over the possible prosecution of his or her predecessor? As we enter a new election cycle, have any candidates expressed a position on this?

- claims that the NRA uses its influence to ""incite violence,"" ""spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence,"" and ""promotes extremist positions.""

547,7ihkgn,False,,27,Should antitrust law and enforcement focus more on vertical integration?,NeutralPolitics,"Net neutrality is the hot topic of the day but another issue at hand is antitrust. Amazon in particular has come under scrutiny after its [acquisition of Whole Foods Market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/06/16/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-market-in-deal-valued-at-13-7-billion-2/?utm_term=.81d2c0921199).

(Full disclosure: I work for Amazon but am obviously posting here in a private capacity.)

Historically, antitrust law has focused on horizontal monopolies, i.e., one firm cornering an entire market by crowding out competitors at the same stage of production. Vertical integration, in contrast, focuses more on owning the entirety of your upstream or downstream production chain. This is an oversimplification but is fine for the purpose of a high level conversation.

In the case of Amazon, acquiring Whole Foods gives them control of grocery distribution to supply their Fresh delivery system. To use another example, [look at the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730906-vertical-integration-could-put-brake-americas-unsustainably-soaring-health-care-costs):

>The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers. If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of United’s pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.

Non-specific tidbits on the [argument in favor](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696911-tech-fashion-old-management-idea-back-vogue-vertical-integration-gets-new) of vertical consolidation:

- Better integrated products (i.e., creating an ecosystem in which it is easier to get everything you need in one space);
- Efficiency of doing things in-house;
- Building customer relationships (via integration and the subsequent creation of frictionless consumer experiences)
- Speed and efficiency from owning your entire production process;
- Minimizing risk across uncertain geopolitical space

The trade-off in this is the potential reduction of consumer choice and ""boxing in"" of customer behavior (see: [Vox's analysis](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2017/12/4/16731310/cvs-aetna-merger) of the Aetna/CVS merger for examples). Likewise, we can see privacy concerns, such as tech ecosystems that collect data in one capacity to inform another (e.g., Amazon using Whole Foods to collect customer behavior data to hone their advertisement algorithms).

Moreover, the reason why I mentioned net neutrality is because implicit in that argument is a concern over information limitation and throttling, but we can see examples of this with firms that own downstream production and content. Using Amazon as an example again, we have [historical examples](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0) of the company deprioritizing book search results related to a publishing dispute. Today, Amazon and Google are in a spat that has resulted in the [loss of Youtube functionality](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices) across Amazon devices.

Thus there is significant control over content here, at least in so far as we have a major player in one market able to influence an area where they have a smaller share but nevertheless major influence on access to a good or service. This is a particularly acute concern where that influence is tethered to a medium or platform with a strong correlation to information dissemination, such as vieo.

The additional historical justification for antitrust law has been the argument that it's bad for consumers, typically by limiting their choice to a single firm that has significant price control. The traditional metrics have been market share and pricing.

But how should we evaluate vertical integration if: (1) it doesn't usually increase market share that much (e.g., Amazon still accounts for very little of the grocery market post-Whole Foods acquisition); (2) arguably it creates a better environment for consumers who want fast and frictionless goods/services, and; (3) we have yet to come up with a strong corollary for market share and price controls as the metrics for ""too much""?

Specific questions:

- Should this be policed more explicitly and increased rigor?
- What are the measurements by which we determine vertical integration has exceeded an appropriate threshold?
- Arguably this is more of a concern across data collection and communication areas. Is this less an antitrust concern and more of a communications and data security matter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7ihkgn/should_antitrust_law_and_enforcement_focus_more/,442,"While vertical mergers may not raise prices for consumers there are political concerns raised by antitrust that should also be considered. Vertical mergers can significantly expand the economic power of a corporation in a given sector. I.e. Aetna acquiring CVS in healthcare, Disney acquiring Marvel in entertainment, and Amazon acquiring Whole Foods in retail. Substantial economic power allows corporations to pursue rent seeking activities like lobbying. 

Thus, political power follows economic power. It seems to me that regardless of consumer prices, whether we deem the consolidation of economic and political power in large corporations a political good is of central concern. One concern I have is that corporations are accountable only to shareholders while the government is accountable to the majority. This is how it ought to be. However, as corporations cross a certain threshold of economic power and rent seeking becomes inevitable the government privileges the interests of corporate shareholders over the majority. This is not how it ought to be. The question: What is that threshold?

however i think the anti-establishment sentiment, or any nationally trending political fad carries only over ""celebrity"" politics. a president has the most individual power a politican can have, voting for a president is the most popular part of the political process, gets most media attention and consequently the most discussion. i infer that people who vote for presidents and not congresspeople do so because they get the idea that since the president has the most power, they don't 'need' to vote for any other position. sort of like a quasi- trickle down politics. so no matter which political movement is trending it is unlikely to see it reflected on a local or state scale since all the focus is on changing the white house. 

from what i gather, bernie's #politicalrevolution can only start to happen after bernie hypothetically gets elected. from his position as president he would be able to consistently reach out to America for political change. as a candidate, only berners will stick to that message. it is unlikely to happen without his presidency and somewhat more likely if he is president, but he would still face the obstacle of people only paying attention to celebrity politics

559,9q6g4b,False,,305,"To what extent is the Trump administration's exclusion of LGBTQ protections from its interpretation of Title IX motivated by a strict and literal interpretation of the law, and has the Trump administrated exhibited a pattern of policies detrimental to LGBTQ people?",NeutralPolitics,"The New York Times published an article titled [""Trump Administration Eyes Defining Transgender Out of Existence""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html) whose first paragraph asserts:

> The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth, the most drastic move yet in a governmentwide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law.

However, the article later refers to the word ""sex"" instead of ""gender"" as the term that the Trump Administration is interpreting. Gender and sex are two distinct concepts; gender refers to psychological, behavioral, and cultural aspects of one's identity and is determined by brain structure whereas sex describes one's physical traits, such chromosomes, gonads, and genitalia. (https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/)

According to the article, the Trump administration may interpret Title IX in a way that excludes protections for LGBTQ people, breaking the Obama administration's precedent. According to the article, people disagreed with the Obama administration's interpretation of the law:

> For the last year, health and human services has privately argued that the term “sex” was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.

[Title IX does not mention gender (or sexual orientation), only sex.](https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm)

- How does the Obama administration's interpretation of Title IX compare with other interpretations of the law, both Title IX and in general?

- Based both on its interpretation of Title IX and its other actions, to what extent is the Trump administration motivated by an earnest stricter or literal interpretation of the law, and has it shown a pattern of policies that harm LGBTQ people?

- What specific judgements has the Trump administration made regarding the definition of gender? Of sex? How are these definitions similar to or different from the medical consensus?

794,6utr1r,False,,29,How does Congress approve funding for specific projects by organizations like the CIA?,NeutralPolitics,"Reposting with a few sources this time,

I am not sure if I am asking in the correct subreddit. I was debating on asking this question here or on /r/AskHistorians. But to me, it seemed more of a political question than a historical one.

In Steve Coll's book, ""Ghost Wars"", there are multiple instances of Congress debating on increasing or cutting the CIA's funding toward the fighting between the Soviets and the mujahedin fighters in Afghanistan in early 70s and 80s. Seemingly all without the public knowing at the time.

My questions are whom in Congress gets to approve this kind of funding? And what measures, if any, does Congress take to prevent the media from discovering these votes?

While I am particularly interested in this specific time period of US history, if someone has a great example from a different time period and/or involving a completely different secret project, I still love to hear about that as long as it addresses my questions about congressional involvement.

With the House of Representatives moving in the direction of impeachment, the subreddit has been inundated with submissions on the details of the scandal, as well as the legal and political processes around it.

The mods are posting this thread to seek advice and feedback from users on how to handle this, as the volume of posts has become difficult, and we have unfortunately had some threads go off the rails.

A few options we have are:

1. **Using ""green"" questions to ask about major new developments.**  That is where the mods will write up a rules-compliant thread on a subject of major interest.  We have done this in the past with similar subjects.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6a9j3d/is_there_evidence_to_suggest_the_firing_of_james/) for example.

2. **Just keep having normal question threads.**

3.  **Create megathreads when major new events happen.** A couple past examples of that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6989bb/ahca_megathread/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9iv4mt/megathread_un_general_assembly/)

180,7q4gmx,False,,218,Is there a significant sentencing disparity between black people and white people in the US that isn't otherwise explained by the difference in crime rates?,NeutralPolitics,"There seems to be a lot of contradictory evidence on this question.  In pursuit of objectivity I'd like to pose it to /r/neutralpolitics.

On the side of ""there is no sentencing disparity"", I found an article [here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/4847/6-leftist-myths-about-criminal-justice-system-get-ben-shapiro) that makes the following claims:

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Overprosecute Blacks.** For literally decades, studies have demonstrated that there is statistical parity between crime reports and arrests. Unless witnesses in the black community – predominantly the victims of black crime – are somehow racist against blacks, cops are arresting people who are guilty of crimes.

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Sentence Blacks Disproportionately Longer.**...studies have actually shown a slightly lower chance of prosecution and slightly lower sentences for black convicts...“A 1994 Justice Department survey of felony cases from the country’s 75 largest urban areas discovered that blacks actually had a lower chance of prosecution following a felony than whites did and that they were less likely to be found guilty at trial. Following conviction, blacks were more likely to receive prison sentences, however – an outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records.”

I couldn't find a source for ""there is parity between crime reports and crime rates"", but if that is true it seems to lend itself to the conclusion being that the higher arrest rate of blacks is due to their higher crime rate, rather than due to prejudice on the part of police officers.  While a counterargument might be that the crime reports are disproportionately done by white members of majority black communities, or by white police officers, this also doesn't take into account the fact that black members of the community or black police officers may also have a bias against black people in that regard, and that this implicitly assumes from the start that white officers and community members have this bias.

I did find [the source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc94.pdf) for the second claim, but I couldn't validate the ""and outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records"" claim.  I couldn't find much information on this one reading the report, but a number of other sources mention this report so I'm inclined to believe it's true.  However I'd like more information.

On the other side, I have [this slate article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/08/racial_disparities_in_the_criminal_justice_system_eight_charts_illustrating.html) which makes a few other claims.

>**Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.**

It gives [this source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/?utm_term=.783daadc09c6).  The counterargument is that black people simply speed more than white people.  I couldn't find evidence for this however, but I'm not sure this is certain evidence of racial bias among police officers.

>**Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than white Americans for the same offense.**

[It uses this source](http://c-6rtwjumjzx7877x24jhtstrnhx78x2ezghx2ehf.g00.slate.com/g00/3_c-6bbb.x78qfyj.htr_/c-6RTWJUMJZX77x24myyux78x3ax2fx2fjhtstrnhx78.zgh.hfx2fknqjx78x2f7568x2f50x2fuik_ufujw_rfwny-wjmfan-wfhnfq-inx78ufwnyd-kjijwfq-hwnrnsfq.uik_$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1).  It's quite long, and I'm not sure if it takes into account prior convictions, which is a potential counterargument.  Furthermore it seems to contradict the second piece of evidence on the other side.  This is the big piece of evidence that I'm confused about, and am not sure which side to believe.

Both of these articles are biased in some way, but I think taking these 2 claims from each of them provides a good starting point for the conversation.  Is there a disparity in sentencing, incarceration, policing, arrests, etc between blacks and whites that can't otherwise be explained by the difference in crime rates?

399,8v5u42,False,,275,What are the arguments for and against abolishing the Immigration and Customs and Enforcement agency (ICE)?,NeutralPolitics,"[Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) is a U.S. law enforcement agency that was formed in 2002 by combining several border and revenue enforcement agencies under the newly established Department of Homeland Security. Its [mission](https://www.ice.gov/about) is to enforce federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety.


Recently, some Democratic candidates have [laid out arguments](https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-to-abolish-ice/) for abolishing the agency and a number of others have [gotten behind the idea.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-democrats-ice-analysis-20180624-story,amp.html) Here's a [full explainer.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17116980/ice-abolish-immigration-arrest-deport)

**5:42 PM EST** Welcome to the 2018 /r/NeutralPolitics election night megathread!  I'll be keeping a running tick tock below as the night goes on.  If you know of helpful resources I can add above please share in the comments and I'll try to integrate them. 

**6:01 PM EST** First polls have closed in eastern KY and most of Indiana.  KY-06 is an interesting race to watch, [rated as a toss up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/6/) by forecasters.  

**6:21 PM EST** Posted a new thread because of an issue with the title of the old thread.  Sorry about the error.

**6:33PM EST** First called race of the night is KY-05 for Republican Harold Rogers.  No surprise there as [he was forecast to win by 50.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/5/)

**7:00 PM EST**  Big poll closing, GA, SC, VA, VT, NH, and most of FL closed.  Remainders of KY and IN closed.  Networks calling **VT** and **VA** Senate for Democrats.

**7:25 PM EST** Lot of votes coming in now.  Looking decently good for Democrats.  McGrath in KY-06 up by 6 with over 40% reporting.  FL-Sen and FL-Gov looking pretty close to 2012 results for Obama (who won FL).

**7:30 PM EST**  Ohio and West Virginia close, no calls.

**7:38 PM EST** First flip of the night, **VA-10** has flipped to democrats.

**7:55 PM EST** OH-Sen has been called for Sherrod Brown (D).  I am still trying to get a handle on IN-Sen, but it seems like a probable R pickup at the moment. But no votes from Bloomington and minimal from Indianapolis, so no calls yet.

**8:00 PM EST** Big poll closing, calls in MA-Sen, CT-Sen, DE-Sen, MD-Sen, PA-Sen RI-Sen all for democrats.  No calls in TN, NJ, ME.  MA-Gov for Baker (R).

**8:22 PM EST** 538's live model now has Republicans favored to take the House.

**8:46 PM EST** 538 [has now changed their model to be less aggressive.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059982719554215936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Also first toss up call of KY-06 has gone to Barr (R)

**8:47 PM EST** ABC has projected Braun (R) to unseat Joe Donnelly in IN-Sen.

**8:59 PM EST** Manchin (WV-Sen) has held his seat.

**9:00 PM EST** Poll closings in a bunch more states.  No call in TX-Sen, TX gov for Abbot.  NY-Gov for Dems, NY-Sen for Dems, No call in AZ-Sen, ND sen no call, MN-Sen (Klobuchar) elected. WI-Sen Dem, WY-Sen R, 

**9:03 PM EST** Networks calling **TN-Sen** for Blackburn (R).  There does not seem to be any path for Democrats to take the Senate.

**9:44 PM EST** Texas Senate is surprisingly close given the overall national environment.  Lot of house races to be called but a lot of small dem leads in them that might give it to the dems.

**9:51 PM EST** NYT has their needle working finally and it is saying dems will win the House (and Beto will lose)

**10:00 PM EST** Polls closing in more states.  Romney wins UT-Sen.  Kobach called loser in KS-Gov to flip that to democrats.

**10:06 PM EST** After some initial freakout for Democrats, looking more like the middle range of the night we expected.  Biggest surprise so far is Donnovan in NY-11 (Staten Island) being ousted.  Very curious to see if that extends to the other NY metro area seats in contention (NY-1 and NY-2 on LI, where there are no results in yet).

**10:16 PM EST** Texas, and with it the Senate, have been called for Republicans, looks like Republicans will pick up 2 to 4 seats in the Senate.

**10:21 PM EST** Networks calling the House for democrats.

**10:42 PM EST** Little downballot news, FL amendment 4 has passed, restoring voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have a felony conviction.  May be a big deal for future FL elections.

**10:55 PM EST** Looks like [Democrats will get a trifecta in New York State.](https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1060017122338844672)

**11:00 PM EST** More poll closings on the west coast.  Everything in the lower 48 is in (apart from people still in line to vote).  Lots more counting to do, but the headline for the night is known.

**11:13 PM EST** NYT projection now has FL-Sen at a 0.0 gap between the candidates.  Who likes Florida recounts?

**11:45 PM EST** Biggest upset of the night so far is in OK-05 where Democrat Kendra Horn has unseated Steve Russell in [a seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%27s_5th_congressional_district) Trump won by 13, and Romney won by 18.

**11:48 PM EST** MO-Sen called for Republicans.  Their 3rd pickup of the night.

**11:49 PM EST** Anyone know why there's no results in Nevada yet?  Polls closed almost 2 hours ago.

**11:55 PM EST** More downballot news, Michigan [has passed a major election reform measure allowing same day registration and no excuse absentee voting.](https://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/1060026162276122627)

**12:04 AM EST** Looks like Democrats will [break GOP supermajority in NC's House, and are leading but not called in enough to do so in the Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-carolina-elections.html) which had led to a lot of [veto overrides.](http://www.wbtv.com/story/38812360/nc-legislature-makes-quick-work-with-veto-overrides/)

**12:20 AM EST** ME-2 has both candidates under 50%, so it looks like this may be the first [usage of Maine's new ranked choice voting scheme.](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/politics/how-maine-is-handling-its-first-general-election-with-ranked-choice-voting/)

**12:24 AM EST** Finally got an answer as to why no results in Nevada, apparently no results are released until all votes are cast, and some people [have been in very long lines in the Reno area.](https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1060039493745487873)

**12:32 AM EST** [Utah and Idaho have approved Medicaid expansion referenda.](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1060041180287787008)   Also looks like a close race in CT-Gov.

**12:48 AM EST** Since we have the headline results baked in, I am going to end the tick tock here.

In the United States, the situation isn't the same, but privacy advocates still have cause to worry.  According to the Supreme Court, the [third party doctrine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/) dictates that if an individual willfully releases private information to a third party, the government doesn't require a warrant to access said information because their is no expectation of privacy on the individual's part. Nonetheless, ten states have privacy rights outlined in their constitutions, as shown [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-protections-in-state-constitutions.aspx) by the national conference of state legislatures.  The right to privacy, as [currently outlined in the common law](https://www.livescience.com/37398-right-to-privacy.html), also influences abortion policy.

What does a fundamental right to privacy entail? Is it public, private, or does sit somewhere in between?

The Constitution gives the people the tools required to fight established institutions and even stage a revolution without breaking the system. It's designed to be adaptable and enforce what is essentially sportsmanlike conduct in class warfare.

167,548hi7,False,,83,Announcing our Debate Fact-Checking Initiative,NeutralPolitics,"We have been thinking about how best to approach the Presidential debates, and have decided that we are going to post live fact-checking threads for at least the first Presidential debate (after which we'll assess and see how it went).  

In deciding on this, we have looked at our past megathreads, such as for the primary election results, primary debates, convention speeches, and the Brexit vote.

The megathread format we most often used, some introductory questions and then a live tick-tock works great for election nights, but not as well for debates and speeches.  So we're gonna try something new.

The way it will work is as follows:

* **All top level comments will be posted by mods.**

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate.  Obviously this will be live so there may be errors.  But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

* **Users can reply to mod comments with a fact check of the candidate statement.**

All fact checks **must** contain a link to a source stating what the true thing is, and must also clearly explain why it contradicts or confirms what the candidate said.  Replies to top level comments without a link will be summarily removed.

* **Users can then reply to each other in third-level and above comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules will still apply.

*Edit for clarification* Since this has come up a couple times: The NP mod team will not be doing the fact checking, but we are rather providing a forum for our users to fact check.

533,c1z103,False,,15,"How has ""Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act"" (2000) affected boxing in the US? What would be the effects of expanding it to cover MMA fighters?",NeutralPolitics,"Background:

* The [Ali Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Boxing_Reform_Act) was enacted in 2000 to address problems in American professional boxing, especially exploitation of athletes and conflicts of interest rampant among promoters. For example, by requiring boxing promotions to disclose financial information, it hoped to stop promotions from downplaying the income generated by fighters--which would in turn lead to fighters receiving a larger cut. It also hoped to make rankings more objective and harder to manipulate.

* Congressman [Markwayne Mullin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin) (R-OK) has introduced a related bill, the [Muhammad Ali Expansion Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/44). As the name implies, it would amend the original Ali Act to include mixed martial arts fighters. This is the second time Mullin has introduced the bill.

* While potential expansion has been discussed in MMA circles from time to time ([e.g., here's something from 2016](https://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/12/11911444/click-debate-whats-all-this-talk-about-the-ali-act-coming-to-mma)), support of the bill by Democratic candidate Andrew Yang ([policy link](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/empowering-mma-fighters/)) has brought greater attention to the issue. (That's how I heard about it; of course, this thread is not about anything else related to Yang.)

* The UFC opposes expanding the Ali Act to include MMA. Of course it's easy to be cynical about this position, but I'd be interested in any good-faith [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) arguments here. For example, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/PFgR2gbzgiI) offering some criticisms of the need for the expansion bill. Also, it's worth remembering that the UFC is not the only MMA organization in the US

* As a general observation, professional boxers make much more money than professional MMA fighters. But this is not only due to fairer contract design; it's also because boxing is just a more popular sport, both for audiences (bigger revenue pool) and athletes (bigger talent pool).

* Fun fact: Congressman Mullin has a professional MMA record of 3-0. Bonus fun fact: Congresswoman [Sharice Davids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharice_Davids) (D-KS) is also a former professional MMA fighter. Bonus bonus coincidence: They are both of Native American heritage.

Questions:

1. Were these genuine problems in boxing at the time of the Ali Act's passage?

2. Are these less of a problem now?

3. If so, can this improvement be attributed to the Ali Act? 

4. Has enforcement of the Ali Act been effective?

5. General question: What have we learned about combat sports regulation with the benefit of 19 years of hindsight?

6. Are these a real problem in MMA now?

7. What are some potential downsides of expanding the Ali Act to include MMA?

- Is it sustainable when there's such unbalance between one territory and another —like it's happening now in Catalonia— and what kind of measures should be used to solve this, taking into account that these kind of conflicts have historically escalated into violence and wars, making that an unacceptable way —and one that the catalans aren't going to push.

Actual question/s are at the bottom, after all the context is given.

Sources for claims in title (basically electoral data), plus involved parties political alignment:

1. [AMI](http://www.municipisindependencia.cat/), Association of Municipalities for Independence (link is official webpage), has, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Municipalities_for_Independence), *""the support of 786 town councils out of the 948 total in Catalonia (82,9%). In addition, 39 out of 42 county councils give support to the association and also all the four Catalan provincial councils.""*

2. The lasting ~20% of City Councils are owned by PSC and CSQEP, which are center-left and hard-left leaning parties that are part of state-wide parties ([PSOE-PSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists%27_Party_of_Catalonia)) and coalitions (CSQEP and [Podemos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_\(Spanish_political_party\))). Those parties are the actual opposition in [the Spanish Congress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spanish_Congress_of_Deputies_\(12th_Legislature\).svg). PSOE (the main spanish opposition party right now —homologous of Democrats in the US, and Labour in the UK) rejected 155 application during all the legislature, but has backed it once the PP-Ciudadanos Government pushed for it earlier this week; Podemos, the 3th party in seats, rejects it all the way.

3. Between the aforementioned City Councils ruled by PSC or CSQEP, are most of the biggest cities in Catalonia, like Barcelona and the cosmopolitan surroundings, Tarragona, or Lleida, making 3 of 4 the province Capitals. This shows an interesting part of the whole point, imo: the political weight that life in big cities —""modern, cosmopolitan life""— has in these kind of matters that affect the rest of a territory, with lower density.

4. Albeit those ~20% of City Councils aren't part of the Association of Municipalities for Independence, many of them have already [openly rejected](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171021/432245123748/alcaldes-psc-piden-rechazar-155.html) the application of 155 —including the Barcelona one, which mayor is part of CSQEP, the coalition party that rejects it in the Spanish Congress. This doesn't mean they will not abide, but it shows their disconformity.

5. The actual [government in Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/XII_legislatura_de_Espa%C3%B1a), elected in 2016 and that pushed for the 155 application this past week, is mainly PP with the support Ciudadanos. Between those 2 parties, they rule one single tiny town in Catalonia (sourced in next point).

5. The only City Council owned by Spain's ruling party (PP) in Catalonia is [Pontons](http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/07/18/la-vida-en-pontons-el-unico-municipio-catalan-donde-gobierna-el_a_23035629/), a 453 citizens municipality, making it an anecdote —still, as a curiosity, that town had a [80% turnout](http://elmon.cat/politica/arrasa-lunic-municipi-governat-pel-pp) in the 1-O 'illegal' referendum.

7. Among the previous point, Ciudadanos, the party that supports PP in Madrid and earns them the Government, hasn't got a single municipality currently —and has only had one single mayor there, in it's brief history.

8. Results of the current events, ~70% Mayors in Catalonia are allegedly [being prosecuted](http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/cataluna/2017/09/08/59b28078e2704e19168b4593.html) for having shown public support and collaboration with organising the 'illegal' 1-O vote.

Further context:

**What is the 155 article of the Spanish Constitution, and why has it been pushed?**

- The 155 article of the Spanish Constitution [was pushed by Spain's Government](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/21/inenglish/1508587023_487115.html) this past weekend, and will have to go through the Senate to be approved. Such article is [a measure](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art%C3%ADculo_155_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978) to shield the State from disobedience in any autonomous community, when any autonomous government (in this case, the catalan Generalitat of Catalonia) rejects following the requests of the Central Government, which would be backed by the Constitutional law that rules us all.

- The reason for Madrid's central government applying the 155 is the Catalan Government push for an Unillateral Declaration of Independence. The reason the Catalan Government has been able to push for that it's because it has [an absolute majority in seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), as of the last elections in pro-Yes parties. After the 'illegal referendum' as the finishing point of the legislature —complying with the main point of their electoral promises— the Independence of Catalonia was [announced yet immediatelly suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/catalan-government-suspends-declaration-of-independence), after the 1st of October vote. The immediate suspension was to call for a dialogue in terms, for negotiating a better way out —a legal one— than the unillateral, after the Catalan Government considered the [1st of October 'illegal' referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendum,_2017) success substantial enough to push for independence. That kind of measure has been compared with the [Slovenian way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioni_Agreement) of gaining independence in 1991.

- This suspenden situation lasted about a month, and the Central Government finally pushed for the 155 to prevent anything else from happening. This will take away any political power from the Catalan Government, rendering the Catalan President unable to push for anything, overtaking any offices they consider necessary for the time being, plus the control of catalan autonomous police, and the public media apparently, too. In other words, the 155 is an 'à la carte' article to make the territories follow the Constitutional law.

- Pushing that article will mean that PP, a party with [8.49% of the votes in Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), will rule that territory for a while —only with the backing of Ciudadanos though, a party that has 17.90% of the vote in Catalonia, summing to 26,4% of the votes of the territory with PP. This engorges 1/4th of the people entitlement, while it creates greater distress over the 48% of pro-Yes voters, being the distress present but lesser in the lasting ~25% (pro-legal-referendum parties).

- Albeit the main goal of the PP is, allegedly, to call for new elections in the Catalan Parliament as soon as possible, [polls show](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20171022/encuesta-elecciones-cataluna-6371299) that the independentist simple majority is consolidated, showing a quasi-identic scenario. As such, pushing for them isn't solving anything apparently, making the situation stuck and unsustainable long term.

Last but not least, for context on independentism in the contemporary world, mainly Europe:

- [Unillateral declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence), being Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo, the last ones in Europe the last half of a Century, after wars and violent episodes.

- ~~Non-unilateral~~ [declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence), in modern Europe, include mainly the countries that were former parts of the USSR, like the Baltic Countries and many Balkanian ones.

**edit**: removed ""non-unilateral"", as that was an error of mine adding it for emphasis, and /u/CQME kindly addressed that this was not right.

---

So, for the question/s, I guess they are:

- **Are there any other modern territories where virtually none of the local councils are represented by the main party, or any coalition, that rules the upper instances of the territory, outside of it?**

- **Are such scenarios sustainable only by the rule of law, which is the only thing the Spanish main parties have said they'll follow, ever?**

---

I'm quite illiterate in terms of history and politics, but the closest situations I know of are:

- The Northern Ireland situation, where they're mainly overruled by the UK in many things (part of the peace treaties), albeit Wikipedia shows me that [there're a big deal of local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland) ruled by unionist parties in Northern Ireland —as far as I can tell, unionist conservative parties like DUP are part of the Conservatives main party, in the House of Commons, and Labour does too, so there's indeed some balance there.

- In Spain, the other really distinct autonomous community, the Basque Country, has too [3 out of 251](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Popular_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco#Elecciones_municipales_y_forales_2015) city councils. However, as center to right Basque Nationalists aren't currently pushing for independence, they actually have some deals with Spain's hard unionist parties like PP and Ciudadanos. (In Spain, which screams conflict, the main voted party is the 4th and 5th party in Catalonia and Basque Country, gathering ).

- It's worth mentiong that the above 2 territories had a violent apporach by radical groups back in the day, being [ETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_\(separatist_group\)) a terrorist group for Basque independentists, and the [IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army), a paramilitary army.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/78engy/the_central_government_of_spain_will_rule/,566,[deleted] ,2017-10-24 09:37:25

Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,[6] UK,[7] and Japan[8][9] suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.

There have been many submissions in the last 24 hours about the [US government shutdown,](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/congress-shutdown-debate.html?_r=0) but none of them conformed to [this subreddit's guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), so they got removed.

Here's a post with the best points from each. Please try to keep the discussion civil.

There's a lot of arguing about who is at fault for the shutdown. In the interest of neutrality, I think it's fair to say there's plenty of blame to go around *(edit: there's been some contention on this point, so [here's is a better explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1nio4r/the_us_government_has_shut_down_lets_discuss/ccizswk?context=1) of the reasoning)*, so instead, let's explore what the different forces hoped to accomplish by letting it get to this point and whether they have succeeded. [Who stands to gain and lose](http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/23/20663446-obama-cruz-among-those-who-could-benefit-from-shutdown?lite) from the shutdown, both politically and in the general population? And what does the evidence suggest about the long-term effects of this event?

Is it reasonable for the people to pursue removal or recall of legislators who failed to appropriate funds in time to avoid a shutdown of the government? How might they go about that?

Is there a real possibility that the government could [fail to raise the debt ceiling next month,](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/how-a-debt-ceiling-crisis-could-become-a-financial-crisis/) leading to a US default on its debt obligations?

This is a touchy subject, so if you're going to make assertions in the comments below, please be sure to support them with evidence by citing a qualified source.

As a side note, we had [a lively discussion prior to the shutdown too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1muhz0/what_are_the_ramifications_of_a_us_government/)

Axios on why the Senate didn't want the ban lifted:

Many of you have recently noted a drop in the quality of discussion on NeutralPolitics. We on the mod team have noted the same, and would like to remind everyone of a few key rules that are critical to the success of the sub.

## Assume good faith

We are all here because we want the best for our respective country and collective world. We don't always agree - in fact, we shouldn't always agree. This space is for us to bounce ideas off of a variety of perspectives, and to gain understanding based on how they respond.
As such, assume good faith when interacting with other members of the NeutralPolitics community. The fact that you and another user advocate for different solutions doesn't mean that you aren't both trying for the best outcome. You may view their solution as bad, and they probably view yours likewise. Accept that and look at the evidence together.


## Sweat the details

Each of us has wide-reaching opinions built on mountains of small facts and assumptions that accumulate to form a worldview. It's all too easy to avoid questioning those assumptions, but this community is an opportunity to test them in order to expand our own understanding of politics and society. If a discussion seems to have come to an impasse, try exploring the components that make up your respective opinions.


## Show your work

This community is dedicated first and foremost to quality information and clear presentation of solid logic. Only with those can we fuel quality discussion. Take the time to understand why you believe what you believe, show us the evidence or underlying logic, and cite your sources.


## Engage with the argument, not the person

Things can get heated when discussing hot-button topics, but please stay focused on the argument, not on making attacks against the person. Even when that doesn't result in a flame war, it still shuts down productive discussion.


We will be increasing our presence in the subreddit, including distinguished posts to provide pointers when we see comments that may not merit removal, but are still not in line with the standard of quality that you all have (hopefully!) come to expect of this subreddit. If you have any questions or suggestions, we are as always happy to chat.

Assuming James Comey's statement is truthful and complete, and taking in all known facts and events to date, what are the legal arguments in support or against President Trump regarding obstructing justice? 

There are those who argue that while Trump's behavior amounts to being ""[excessive and bizarre](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448386/james-comey-testimony-donald-trump-actions-are-questionable),"" they do not meet the legal burden of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice is defined under [18 U.S.C. § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) and committed by those who “[corruptly](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515), or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress.”

As [this write up in Lawfare](https://lawfareblog.com/was-firing-james-comey-obstruction-justice) explains (excellent read), there are 3 elements of proof in order to find a crime:

2. the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending
3. the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the 
proceeding was pending.

Continuing Lawfare's post:
> The questions here surround the third element. One must not merely “influent, obstruct, or impede” but also do so corruptly. Under § 1515(b), a corrupt state of mind requires intent: “acting with an improper purpose.

617,bomcl1,False,,212,What are the arguments for and against expunging marijuana convictions in legalization legislations?,NeutralPolitics,"I was recently reading an article in the NYT about marijuana legalization laws hitting a wall in New York and New Jersey.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html)

One of the points the article mentions about New Jersey, when talking about possibly reviving the legalization movement there, is that:

>...in New Jersey, the proposal’s sponsors have discussed changing the current bill, including removing an expungement provision that would have cleared convictions for people who were caught in possession of up to five pounds of marijuana.

It seems the expungement of marijuana convictions is a controversial topic when trying to pass these legislations. Looking at other states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, the topic of expungement is indeed controversial: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they\_n\_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they_n_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da)

Given what' I've read, the arguments **for** seem to relate to fairness as well as civil rights:

>“I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.” 

And on the Civil Rights front:

>The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the[ American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white).

On the **against** side, the article quotes this argument:

>Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

So my questions are:

1. How do jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana address these concerns about other offenses that are not in the books?
2. Are there any other arguments for or against expunging marijuana convictions (as part of legalization efforts OR after the fact)?

Side Note: New Jersey and New York are special in this case as they are the first **states** ([some territories have](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#539b23f027ea))  to try to pass recreational legalization by state legislation ([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline\_of\_cannabis\_laws\_in\_the\_United\_States#/State](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States#/State)).

Thanks to everyone who contributed.

Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign pledging to keep manufacturing companies from moving jobs overseas. On Tuesday, air conditioning company [Carrier said it had reached a deal with President-elect Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana.](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2016/11/29/carrier-trump/94638336/) The state of Indiana plans to [give economic incentives to Carrier](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html) as part of the deal to stay.

So, some questions:

* What are the pros and cons of the deal itself?
* What are the wider implications of the deal? 
* Is there evidence to indicate that a President who takes an interest in individual deals like this can have a substantial effect across the economy? 
* Is it unusual for a President to insert himself into individual negotiations like this, and if so, does it set a precedent?
* Can the working class people who Trump targeted in his campaign see a substantial benefit from moves like this?
* What kinds of wider effects do deals like this — tax incentives in exchange for not moving jobs offshore — have on wealth inequality?
* Do companies like Carrier, who are direct beneficiaries of a tax incentive, end up with a competitive advantage over other players in the marketplace, and if so, what are the pros and cons of that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5fzjhc/presidentelect_trump_has_struck_a_deal_with/,546,"I actually really like the approach that Sen.

For example, black people are actually not victims of white racism. White racism is in fact so rare that many of the 'hate crimes' such as black church vandalism etc were actually perpetuated by blacks and liberals to make their 'cause' look more legit. This much is at least admitted by the media in individual cases. 4 different ones I know off the top of my head.

In fact, the opposite is true. White people are constantly victims of black racism. There is effectively lynchings of white people every day...however the method of execution is not by lynching. Burning white people to death seems to be the preferred method.

There is a pervasive and energetic propaganda campaign against white people in commercials and television and movies. You will notice this quickly if you simply watch TV and decide to be aware of it. Whenever a character is evil or whenever a character is stupid, it's a white guy. Try to tell me a single evil or stupid character from any movie in the past 15 years who wasn't white?

Despite the existence of anti white racist policies in the letter of the law under the umbrella term 'affirmative action', white people are still widely perceived to have institutional privilege and many organizations actually call for white people to pay reperations for slavery...as if white people invented the concept of slavery.

In academia which are mainly controlled by the left...history classes focus on every bad thing white people did...while ignoring or trivializing the contributions white people made. Everyone in school quickly learns about  the worst slave owners and small pox blankets. Most people never learn about William Wilberforce or William murray or the massacre committed by tecumseh.

Thanks to drastically declining birth rates and increasing suicides, the white race is actually in the process of dying off. Feminism has much to do with this because the majority of feminists are white. We are 'projected' to be a minority in the us in about 30 years...the reality is actually probably much sooner. Europe will likewise meet a similar shift especially with people like Marcozy insisting that whites must practice miscegenation for the greater good.

The alt right is really composed of people who have noticed this rather unfair and racist war against white people. Its an attempt to counter ethnic cleansing programs against us. Obviously if you choose to remain oblivious to the reality that is never spoken of then it would appear to be white supremacist...especially because the media has brainwashed people into thinking that anyone who is concerned for the welfare of whites must be white supremacist since 'obviously' we are privileged and 'obviously' we controlled everything.

953,4y5xb9,False,,125,Stop and frisk: is it effective?

The strategy involves stopping and questioning pedestrians, followed by frisking the individual for contraband. The practice was [officially legalized]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_v._Ohio) in the Supreme Court case Terry v Ohio, as long as reasonable suspicion exists. 

The policy has been linked by some to lower crime rates in the city during the period, and some [have accused its decline]( http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-big-fall-stop-and-frisk-criminals-bolder-article-1.2247406) as responsible for rising crime rates. However, some studies have found [little evidence]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.712152) that stop and frisk by itself has an effect on crime, though on the other hand, other cities [have seen]( http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/17/does-stop-and-frisk-reduce-crime/stop-and-frisk-has-lowered-crime-in-other-cities) similar declines in crime rates after the policy’s adoption.

The legality of the practice has been questioned as well, especially since “probable cause” can be quite difficult to define.

I take away a few things from the articles above:

* There's a growing sense among voters in the west that the winners from globalization are foreigners and the elites, while the losers are the hardworking local populations. 
* The result is that populism is on the rise.
* Left-wing and right-wing populism have the same origins. Considering them separate entities is to misunderstand the root causes.
* The power of these movements has been consistently underestimated by the political classes and the media entities who respond to them. Brexit and the nomination of Donald Trump are the clearest examples, but Spain, Greece, France and Denmark also have had recent cases of the ruling classes scrambling to maintain their hold on power in the face of populist revolts at the ballot box.
* The people, by and large, aren't buying the scary rhetoric of the ruling class about the negative consequences of setting out a populist and/or nationalist agenda.

I'd first like to know if any of those are incorrect conclusions and why.

But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

Let me be clear that I'm not passing judgment on populism here. If that is a necessary and expedient path to fair and equitable treatment of the citizenry, so be it. But [the history doesn't consistently favor that view,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) so I'm wondering if there are proven alternatives.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4q447n/globalism_brexit_and_the_rise_of_populism_is/,515,">But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

My question is why should you seek the continuing reduction of immigration barriers when immigration barriers have already been reduced.

Globalization vs populism is a bit of a false dichotomy, because while there might be those who are anti immigration, there are those who might enjoy benefits of globalization yet want to put some limits on the slippery slope due to partly valid reasons. So one can be for globalization but to a point. If globalization is without any end point or limits, then it is something that a bigger number of people will oppose.

If you keep pushing after already succeeding at reducing immigration barriers, eventually you are going to reach a point of resistance. So maybe it isn't quite fair to see the others as too anti-immigration, perhaps those who are pro globalization are too pro-immigration while the majority support immigration but controlled immigration (and then there are those who are more xenophobic).

So the wise thing could be to simply take in mind the value of not alienating people by pushing for lowering even more immigration barriers for example. So, I disagree that the most valid question is how to succeed at even more and more globalization.

Globalization is not all or nothing, and it can succeed in providing more sustainable and better results even more if we give a care about nation states democracies and even some nativism as important. Else, you are going to see more Trump and far right and more of the ugly side of nationalism. So the answer to the question of how to reduce populism in reaction to globalization is to allow space for some nationalism and for globalization to coexist, else to suffer under the people going for more populism and extreme force of nationalism.

It is also important for some diversity of opinions to exist among the elite or establishment. If they are more or less relatively uniformly pro reducing immigration barriers or pro increasing immigration from muslims, then it makes it more likely for extremists (and extremists in more issues than immigration) to be those willing to tell the public what it wants to hear.

629,ebr0lq,False,,74,What powers are vested in the Chief Justice as the presiding judge in an impeachment trial?,NeutralPolitics,"After a president is impeached by the House, the conviction trial takes place with the Senate acting as the jury and the Chief Justice of the United States acting as the judge. As [precedent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/) indicates, impeachment is purely a political process and not a legal one. Therefore, the rules and procedures of a traditional trial that most people are most familiar with do not exactly apply in an impeachment trial.

In fact, according to the *[Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials]( https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf)*, in an impeachment trial, the “Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue… all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate may authorize or provide.” In other words, as the majority party of the Senate, the GOP appears to have the power to set the rules.

Furthermore, the rules also state (bold emphasis by me):

> And the Presiding Officer on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy  of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, **unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate**; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

And thus it seems that the Chief Justice can be overridden in their rulings if a majority of the Senate votes on it.

I have little if no doubt that is why Pompeo [was there](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/photos-mike-pompeo-meeting-with-north-korea-leader-kim-jong-un.html) some months ago.

If it will be a lasting peace? Who can say, but I do think this one will be far more permanent then previous attempts. The North Korean's single chance at having a weapon that served as a deterrent to the US (rather then simply South Korea) is gone. It is hard to bare your teeth to demand everyone come to the table when you have no choice. Kim Jong-Un is no fool, he knows if he doesn't come to some form of peace agreement without the threat of a nuclear weapon this all collapses. 

I doubt there will be much effect from the Trump visit, and I doubt truly we ACTUALLY had an effect other then simply being an intelligence agency that the South Koreans could rely on, but it will look good for the international community and US sources will call this a ""victory"" for Trump, or at least something on his presidential bingo board, no different the Barack Obama on Bin laden ",2018-04-29 14:52:49

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have *time*. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/index) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

Mods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. Roughly 70% of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and or work with them to craft an acceptable post.

Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. In order to help new users acclimate to our standards of discourse, we are refocusing our efforts to maintain moderator presence in the comments, so you'll be expected to reply to some of those as well.  

Other responsibilities include:

* Message an OP asking him to modify his submission.
* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with a brief explanation of why you want to join the team and why you would be a good fit and also include your stance on avocado toast. Do not tell us your political leaning, any application that includes that information will automatically be dropped.

Also, we would like to take this time to answer questions and take feedback from users, so let's talk!

The bill itself can be found online [here](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s2383/BILLS-115s2383is.pdf), and is not that long of a read. The gist of the bill is that it is amending the Stored Communications Act to fix problems that the proponents claim are in American internet-related laws. 

[Andrew Woods and Peter Swire writing at Lawfare Blog](https://lawfareblog.com/cloud-act-welcome-legislative-fix-cross-border-data-problems) support the legislation, saying things like 

>Moreover, a number of safeguards are built into the bill. The bill creates a mechanism whereby providers can apply for a motion to quash or modify legal process if the provider reasonably believes the subscriber is not a U.S. person and that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government. It also requires a court to conduct a comity analysis in the event of such a motion to quash, which may alleviate foreign government concerns about sovereign interests. It is not clear why this comity provision is in the statute except as a symbolic gesture; courts were already free under the common law to conduct a comity analysis in thinking through whether to issue an order with extraterritorial impact. Its presence in the statute is perhaps a reminder that trust and mutual respect play an important role in these cross-border matters. 

The EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation - [opposes the bill](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), stating its issues with the law: 

>The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act expands American and foreign law enforcement’s ability to target and access people’s data across international borders in two ways. First, the bill creates an explicit provision for U.S. law enforcement (from a local police department to federal agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to access “the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information” about a person regardless of where they live or where that information is located on the globe. In other words, U.S. police could compel a service provider—like Google, Facebook, or Snapchat—to hand over a user’s content and metadata, even if it is stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country’s privacy laws.

• Is the bill an invasion of privacy or is it just clarifying outdated legislation?

• What are the implications on currently active cases?

How is this not an issue?   

If the company wants to have information in another country be private, shouldn't they restrict access to that information to employees located in that same other country?  Wouldn't that fix the issue?

----------------------------

It has been [well reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/trump-tariffs-foreign-autos.html) that the President of the United States has broad authority to impose tariffs on products that detract from U.S. national security.

> The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security.

Bolstering his position, President Trump has cited [a report](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/the_effect_of_imports_of_steel_on_the_national_security_-_with_redactions_-_20180111.pdf) published by the U.S. Department of Commerce that asserts steel imports harm national security in the long run.

However the Commerce Department report addresses Canada directly:

> Our goal is to maximize domestic capabilities combined with supplies from unquestionably reliable third parties. The one supplier in whom I have complete confidence is Canada. Not only do we currently have a steel surplus with Canada, but we share a border and have synergistic strategic, economic, and national security interests. However, treating Canada as a unique partner under any Section 232 relief measures requires that Canada also strengthen and align its trade enforcement efforts with ours. [Appendix F, p.60]

This seems to indicate Canada and the United States share a special relationship in regards to trade, and steel specifically, and also seems to weaken the argument (while not entirely) that Canada is a threat to U.S. national security of steel production.

---- This question is very limited - I do not want to raise the significantly more complicated question of whether this is good idea for *the overall relationship* between the U.S. and Canada.

Yesterday, House Republicans released the full text of the bill they hope will fulfill the ""replace"" part of their ""repeal and replace"" policy with regards to Obamacare. The 123 page bill contains [the following major changes](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement): 

* The individual mandate is removed.  Instead insurers can charge people who have had a 2 month coverage gap up to 130% of normal prices.

* Keeps guaranteed issue and community rating, though age bands permitted are wider.

* Medicaid expansion stops taking new people in 2020.


* Medicaid becomes ""per-capita block granted""

* The ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is preserved

* Children can still stay on their parents' coverage until age 26

The plan has already been [criticized](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-s-obamacare-replacement-plan-faces-four-big-obstacles-n730001) on a number of grounds, with many GOP lawmakers [already stating](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/conservatives-revolt-against-gop-obamacare-repeal-replacement/518775/) they oppose it. Criticisms range from it keeping too much of Obamacare's architecture, merely tweaking it rather than properly replacing it, while the left has accused it of favoring the wealthy and not addressing major issues with healthcare in the US.

http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/2000639-an-analysis-of-senator-bernie-sanderss-tax-proposals.pdf

The Washington Post highlights that this plan would raise around 15.3 Trillion over the next decade and obviously lead to increase of taxes across the board. The average increase would be around $9000 per household, though that mainly comes from the highest earners in America paying the most with the average increase for the middle class would be around 4700.

Comparing it to Hillary's plan that Urban-Brookings reviewed yesterday, her plan raises a lot less overall at 1.1 trillion over the decade, but has less of an effect on the average american overall compared to Bernie's in taxes. The bottom 95% of taxplayers would see little change, while the top 5% would see large increases, though less overall than in Sanders' plan.

Bernie has argued that his tax increases will be offset by what it will pay for, but will voters go for that, especially given how many economists split on his plan.

The reason I came up with this question is because of the strong correlation between unemployment, lesser education, low income and the Brexit vote (as shown in the FT article I posted above). If we assume job dissatisfaction was the core issue of Brexit vote, how come youths voted for remain instead of leave?

I acknowledge that youths are generally liberal, and they benefit a lot from free movement and ability to get educations or meet different people in different places of Europe. Nevertheless, if their job condition is not satisfactory, I still wonder why it almost didn't have any noticeable impact.

Just want to point out I'm only an undergrad interested in this issue so a lot of my presumptions may be wrong, and I'm all happy and open to acknowledge and fix my errors. Thanks in advance.

---**EDIT**---

Thanks for many responses. There one point that I want to make it clear:

* I made a debatable premise that people with difficult economic circumstances voted for Brexit. Indeed it doesn't make any sense at a glance as Brexit will hurt the national economy more. But then again, a lot of people speculate that they didn't vote rationally. Also, statistics from the FT article shows strong correlation between lower income / unemployment and Brexit support. Finally, many of their arguments such as about £350 million to be taken back or immigrants taking their jobs, are in my opinion, manifesting that their Brexit vote were stemming from their economic dissatisfaction *they perceived* as resulted from joining the EU.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4qfmn2/why_did_youths_vote_for_remain_on_brexit/,250,[removed] ,2016-06-29 13:55:32

682,4jxcps,False,,150,"Firms like Uber classify drivers as contractors, rather than as employees. Is this business structure legally legitimate, or merely an attempt to get around employment laws?",NeutralPolitics,"Uber, the massive ridesharing company with a current valuation [greater than that of GM]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/12/04/at-68-billion-valuation-uber-will-be-bigger-than-gm-ford-and-honda/#574856a55858), has grown by adopting a rather unique business model. Whereas a traditional firm hires employees to do its work, Uber claims to be a networking service, connecting customers with independent contractors within its network. Following this model, Uber has [grown massively](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0822-uber-revenue-20150822-story.html) in the last several years.

However, widespread opposition to the Uber business model has grown simultaneously. While some applaud Uber for [lowering prices for consumers]( http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/uber-lowers-fares-in-over-100-cities/) by bypassing the artificial constraint on supply created by [taxi medallions]( https://www.thestreet.com/story/13385263/1/the-one-chart-that-should-worry-uber-and-hurts-the-taxi-medallion-short-selling-thesis.html), others have questioned the source of its success. In particular, [some claim that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) far from improving general economic efficiency and social welfare, Uber has become so successful by effectively shifting the burden of many employment costs from themselves to their “contractors”. In the US, as in many other nations, workers are entitled to [a wide number of workplace rights]( https://www.dol.gov/dol/rights-benefits.htm), including mandated breaks, the right to unionize, provision of healthcare benefits and so on. By avoiding direct legal “employment” of drivers, it is argued, Uber lowers costs to itself by making life more miserable for its drivers. 

Indeed, there has been a growing movement among drivers themselves to be recognized as employees precisely to claim the legal protections that come with classical employment, with the entire company now facing a [massive class-action lawsuit](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-appeals-class-action-ruling-in-worker-misclassification-lawsuit/) on the matter; in California, the legal status of Uber drivers as employees [has already been established]( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-labor-commissioner-rules-uber-driver-employee-not-independent-contractor.html). They key point seems to be the legal definition of “contractor”, which is similar in many states. For example, [one author states that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3):

>Under California law, the principal factor in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor is whether the employer “to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.”

Uber drivers argue (successfully, in California) that [the degree to which Uber controls its drivers]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) means they are employees, not contractors. However, there is also some evidence that driver discontent may be an isolated phenomenon: one study [has suggested that](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/For-Hire-Vehicle-Transportation-Study.pdf) drivers significantly prefer contracting with Uber over working for traditional cab companies. 

Interestingly, this reclassification of employees as contractors has become [a larger pattern in the American economy that sociologists have named “Uberization”]( http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/18/rise-uberized-economy-means-business/). Thus, the current legal struggle affects not just Uber drivers, but has significant implications for the future of employment across the nation as a whole. 

To summarize: ***Are Uber employment practices legal or not? Do they truly add to the efficiency of the economy, or are they merely transferals of costs? Are the protests of the drivers legitimate?***

Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort **by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election. As described in this executive summary and the report thatfollows, President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.** The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditionedtwo official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

Entirely disregarding the President's stated purpose of investigating Joe Biden and his Son's actions in the Ukraine in an apparent attempt to get attention off him attempting to investigate illegal actions of the Bidens and onto ""the attempt"" to investigate.

All while ignoring the extreme hypocrisy that accusing the president of ""attempting to influence the 2020 election"" is 1] not only implying that anyone in a political position to even ""potentially"" run for president is immune from investigation but 2] Exactly what their self-stated ""Political"" investigation of the president is doing Literally the same thing they are accusing the president of.

711,7yn91o,False,,41,What impacts exist with counting prisoners using the current method in the US census?,NeutralPolitics,"There was [a recent article in the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-census-prison-population_us_5a7cb966e4b044b3821b0507) that made me start thinking about this issue. 

The author of the article focuses primarily on the issue of redistricting based on this information. I was curious about other impacts, such as potential resources being diverted from lower income areas because of the way prisoners are being counted. Are there ways that this can affect areas beyond just the redistricting angle? 

The article is referring to the announcement on 14 February that the Census Bureau will continue the trend of counting prisoners at their location of incarceration, what they deem to be their 'usual residence'. [Their webpage](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html) explains the reasoning behind this.

> The Census Act of 1790 established the concept of “usual residence” as the main principle in determining where people should be counted, and this concept has been followed in all subsequent censuses. “Usual residence” has been defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's voting residence or legal residence.

The article cites a [memo (pdf alert) from the Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/letters/2016/PPI_Demos_2016_FRN_comment.pdf) that lays out an argument for not counting prisoners where they are incarcerated. 

The numbers are not yet out for 2017, but with [a prison population at the end of 2016](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6187) of around 1.5 million people, it is worthy of discussion; looking at the arguments for and against counting prisoners where they are imprisoned and the potential impacts either direction can have on communities

Gavin Newsom (D) announced plans to support a bill in the state legislature to cap how much landlords can raise rent prices with the goal of limiting price increases, increasing housing availability, and lowering housing prices. The bill, AB 1482, would limit yearly rent increases to 5% (plus the rate of inflation) for the next decade and grant minor eviction protections to renters. Newsom and his allies in the state legislature argue that the bill will help end price gouging and improve the current state of the California rental market. Conversely, the Californian Assn. of Realtors argues that the rent cap will disinsentivize the construction and production of new rental housing units and exsaserbate the already scarce and pricey rental market.

There are two large ongoing wildfires in California. The Camp Fire has covered more than [156 square miles](https://abc7news.com/maps-a-look-at-the-camp-fire-in-butte-county-and-other-california-fires/4656293/) (404 km^2 ) between Chico and the Plumas National Forest in Northern California and remains only 20% contained. Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire covers 109 square miles (282 km^2 ) in the area around Thousand Oaks and Malibu west of Los Angeles and is 0% contained.

President Trump has stated that the fires are due to [forest mismanagement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/trump-mismanagement-forests-blame-california-fires-181110085539030.html) on California's part, and has threatened to cut off federal funding if that is not remedied.

However, a spokesperson for CA Governor Jerry Brown and the president of California Professional Firefighters have both stated that nearly [60% of California's forests are under federal control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/10/trump-blames-gross-mismanagement-wildfires-leave-trail-death-destruction-california/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.70481f8af284), including a majority of the areas affected by the fires, and that the state has increased its funding for forest services while the federal government has cut back funding for it.

Experts have blamed the unusually intense fires on excessive build-up of flammable material due to [decades of fire suppression](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Trump-on-California-s-Camp-Fire-Forest-13380388.php) as well as ""rising temperatures and longer spells of dry weather.""

1. Could any forest services in the areas affected by the fire be characterized as negligent, inefficient, underfunded, or otherwise poorly executed? If, so by whom?

**What is the AHCA?**

It is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.

**What does it do?**

Lots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)

**What are the recent amendments to it?**

There have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:

* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.

* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for ""high risk pools"" for persons with pre-existing conditions.

**What's going on with it now?**

House leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.

**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)

The House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)

**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.


The AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.

**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.

**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.

**What happens in the German government if no party can form a majority?** Are minority governments possible given German law? I can't find anything references the formation of a minority government since German reunification, so I assume there hasn't been one. Am I correct in assuming there hasn't been one though? And if that's the case, was it because such a thing was unnecessary or impossible?

- Just like any other parliamentary government, an absolute majority of a party, or a coalition, is not necessary. Instead the ruling party is forced to form temporary coalitions on an issue-by-issue basis. It can go both ways; on the one hand it can make for a very functioning democracy because minorities are involved in legislation, on the other hand it can result in a stalemate.

- If a stalemate is reached, through the process of a ""constructive vote of no-confidence"" the President (not the chancellor) can dissolve the parliament and force a snap election.

It comes down to how likely the ruling party sees its ability to get things done in a minority government, or in the other case whether its cards are better in a snap election. ",2018-01-15 01:28:26

First Past the Post AKA Plurality AKA Single-Choice Voting: http://www.prsa.org.au/pluralit.htm

>A plurality electoral system is one where ballots are normally not valid unless they have been marked by the voter to indicate the candidate or candidates that the voter wishes to have elected, but no more candidates can be indicated in this way than the number of vacancies to be filled, without invalidating the ballot, so the information that voters are allowed to provide about their ranking of the candidates in their order of preference for them is deliberately and unnecessarily limited. Each candidate marked gets equal value from the vote, as voters cannot indicate their preferred priority among the candidates. Each mark is thus a first preference vote, but there is no provision for any later preferences of voters for candidates with more votes than they need - or of the candidates with the fewest votes - to be indicated, for transfer to remaining continuing candidates.

As we have seen this election the polarization of the electorate has become particularly intense as presidential candidates have been using the anger of the electorate to gain support.

967,5wsy55,False,,163,"Is there a health insurance ""coverage gap""? If so, why are some people too poor for ACA/""Obamacare"" and too rich for Medicaid?",NeutralPolitics,"A common criticism against ACA/""Obamacare"" is that there still remains a significant health care coverage gap where people who have no other coverage and can't afford an ACA plan will be fined on their income taxes.

[healthcare.gov outlines the exemption rules as follows:](https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool/#/results/2016/details/marketplace-affordability)

> Coverage is considered to be unaffordable if the lowest cost Bronze-level plan available to you through the Marketplace in 2016 is more than 8.13% of your household income.

> The total cost to you must be more than 8.13%, accounting for any premium tax credit you would qualify for if you enrolled in that plan.

> If you qualify for this exemption, it may apply to everybody on your tax return.

This sounds completely reasonable and it would surprise me if there really are many people who will unavoidably incur the penalty.

Is there really a coverage gap? If so, how significant is this problem? What estimates have been published for the number of Americans that are uninsured because they do not have an employer that provides health insurance, cannot afford an ACA plan, do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, and are not merely refusing or neglecting to purchase a plan? Are there many people who have no other coverage and cannot reasonably afford ACA or do most of these people instead just not *want* to pay for coverage?

If the gap does exist and affects many people, why does it exist? Was it purely an oversight in the ACA itself or is it somehow the unforeseen consequence of a mix of factors?

Here's [an example](http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/21/news/economy/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-texas/) of an article talking about the coverage gap. The article gives a few anecdotes about people in Texas, a state which refused the Medicaid expansion. The numbers do sound pretty bad in that case.

>In interviews with a dozen diplomats, many of whom declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak about anything related to the next U.S. president, some said spending money at Trump’s hotel is an easy, friendly gesture to the new president.

Before the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) was ratified in 1912, Senators weren't directly elected; instead, State legislatures appointed two Senators for six year terms each. George Mason, one of the original founders, argued that [""...state legislative solutions gave states the power of self-defense against the federal government.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) Wendell Pierce held a different view, arguing that [""...the contrast between a state legislatively-appointed Senate and a popularly elected House would increase the types of interests represented in the federal government. By requiring the consent of two different constituencies in the House and the state legislatures in the Senate-- the composition of the Senate was seen as essential to the system of bicameralism, which would require 'the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy'.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii)

Contrast this with the German [Bundesrat](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/organisation-en/organisation-en-node.html). According to the [*German Basic Law (Article 51)](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Rather than two representatives with six year terms per person inhabiting the institution, the state governments send delegations of representatives that act in the will of the composition of that state, ensuring indirect majority-rule from the bottom-up. Each delegation receives votes based on the population of their state; [""Länder (State governments) with more than two million inhabitants shall have four, Länder with more than six million inhabitants five, and Länder with more than seven million inhabitants six votes.""](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Most German states use some variation of proportional representation for their electoral systems, so representatives tend to represent more than [two political parties at once](https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/bilder/EN/artikel/zusammensetzung.jpg?__blob=panorama&v=23).  They're subject to [recall](http://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/english/germanyenglish.html) at any time by the state government, whereas U.S Senators [are not](https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/02/02/can-u-s-senators-be-recalled/).  


Is the German system of majority rule in both federal legislative houses conducive to people's liberty or detrimental to the long-term liberty of the people? Does it represent everyone or is it failing in protecting minorities? By and large, do U.S Senators succeed or fail to represent their state, and if they fail, does the German system offer a means by which to achieve success?  Is it possible to reconcile gerrymandering and the two-party system with fair representation in government alongside the goal of Senators to represent the entirety of their state in the federal legislature?

How does one define the representation of a state:  If its the government, does that mean the entire legislative branch of a state is represented or merely the majority?  If it's the people, then does that include everyone, or the constituents who voted for said U.S Senators?

Those laws are:

* [**AB-450**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB450) which requires in relevant part that California employers not provide information to Federal immigration agents, or allow them access to nonpublic areas, except as required by federal law or when presented with a warrant, subpoena or other court order.

* [**AB-103**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB103) which requires  the Attorney General of California, or his or her designee, to engage in reviews of county, local, or private locked detention facilities in which noncitizens are being housed or detained for purposes of civil immigration proceedings in California.

* [**SB-54**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54) which prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from sharing information with the US government around immigrants in California custody, or transferring them to Federal custody, with some exceptions for certain listed felonies, and for when a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination is presented to California authorities.

666,hr8jce,False,,263,What evidence supports/discourages raising the minimum wage?,NeutralPolitics,"As far as I can tell, there is evidence on both sides of this issue.

On one hand, some people aren't able to live off of minimum wage when working full time: https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/06 (This of course is dependent on location. Switch to, say, Wyoming and it might look different.) In addition, an increased minimum wage would supposedly require very little increase in prices and/or decrease in profit taking (a 10% increase in minimum wage is correlated with a 0.3% increase in CPI, see page 3): https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2017/the-local-aggregate-effects-of-minimum-wage-increases.aspx#:~:text=Abstract,outcomes%20besides%20employment%20and%20wages.&text=minimum-wage%20workers.-,Increases%20in%20minimum%20wages%20also%20lower%20debt%20among%20households%20with,to%20increase%20access%20to%20credit.

353,5q7ssu,False,,175,Does President Trump's international business empire cause conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution?,NeutralPolitics,"-----

**Introduction:**

-----

I am a lawyer with an interest in Constitutional Law, but I practice Family Law and therefore may not have the absolute best grasp of the interpretation of Constitutional Law.

Moreover, the Emoluments Clause is somewhat obscure, not often covered or taught in law school, and not often discussed in my area of law other than theoretically.

I am posting to foster discussion on this topic, learn, and better understand how President Trump's business empire interacts with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution.

-----

**Sources:**

The information I have gathered purporting a violation of the Emoluments Clause is best summed up in [this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gs_121616_emoluments-clause1.pdf) paper.

-----

**Summary:**

-----

I implore you to read both papers in their entirety, but for brevity sake as a brief introduction, or as a refresher after you've read them - here is my understanding of the argument that these papers make.

-----

[Article I, Section 9](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/68/emoluments-clause) of the Constitution provides as follows: “No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And **no Person holding any Office** of Profit or Trust under them, **shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”**

-----

Violation?

-----

The Eisen paper argues for a broad interpretation of the clause, stating **""...the Clause unquestionably reaches any situation in which a federal officeholder receives money, items of value, or services from a foreign state.**

The Eisen paper concludes that **While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive—by virtue of his continued interest in the Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities—a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents.** Applied to Mr. Trump’s diverse dealings, **the text and purpose of the Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed.**  

-----

No Violation?

-----

The Grewal paper argues for a narrower interpretation, stating that **""...Only transactions conducted at other than arm’s length, or transactions involving the provision of services by the President personally, establish potential violations.""**

Under an office-related definition, the sale of goods generally would not give to emoluments, such as where she sold property at an arm’s length price to a foreign government. Under this reading, only goods sold at other than fair market value would trigger an Emoluments analysis.

**Specific Instances of Potential Foul Play:**

-----

*Taken directly from the Eisen paper paper;*

**Discussion Outline:**

-----

I'd like to refrain from discussing the penalties for violating the Emoluments Clause, how important you think the Emoluments Clause is in relation to other issues, or whether or not you think violating the Emoluments Clause matters.

The main points I'd like to discuss have to do with the text and interpretation of the Emoluments Clause as applied to President Trump's international business presence and whether or not it has been or is being violated.

Another interesting point of discussion is how most Presidents have used a ""blind trust"" to circumvent problems regarding the Emoluments Clause - in which you place pre-Presidential personal holdings in a trust and give complete control to an independent third party - and how President Trump's discussion of ""[giving control to his son](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/11/news/trump-business-conflicts-plan/)"" may or may not cure the defect or satisfy the blind trust requirements of an independent third party.

Last, I would like to discuss which interpretation of the Emoluments Clause is better to achieve the goal of anti-corruption from foreign powers, and which of the enumerated specific instances you believe either do or no not violate one or both interpretations of the Emoluments Clause. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5q7ssu/does_president_trumps_international_business/,565,"This may sound like a way to sweetened version, but I'd *think* since the clause is in article 1 it only applies to congress.

Is Federal research money widely enough needed at American Colleges and Universities to make nationwide change? What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to stifle Free Speech?,NeutralPolitics,"On Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), [President Trump announced an Executive Order](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-to-sign-executive-order-requiring-colleges-universities-to-support-free-speech-on-campus) that would require Universities and Colleges to support free speech under the penalty of having their federal research money cut:

> “If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people, to speak, free speech,” said Trump. “If they don’t, it will be very costly. That will be signed very soon.”

I have a couple of questions:

1: How many Colleges and Universities seek Federal research money? Specifically, what percentage of Universities and Colleges seek Federal research money?

2: The written order has not yet been released, so there's some ambiguity to what ""support free speech"" means, but the President left little ambiguity that he believes there is a free speech problem on America's campuses. 

What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to limit free speech? Is this a new occurrence? Have they stated why they are doing it?

[This article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431012/fixing-illegal-immigration-five-steps) argues for a strictly enforced kind of ""one strike"" policy, whereby anyone found to have entered the country illegally is thereafter ineligible for any legal status.

> Eliminate incentives for those who would come here to live off the rest of us, and make it easier and more rational for those who wish to come here legally to contribute to our economy. No walls, no government databases, no biometric national ID cards. But not a penny in welfare for immigrants.

This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.

There exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military.

>With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.

>The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.

Pakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016.

However, [Verizon's CEO recently made a statement that Bernie is entirely incorrect](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/senator-sanders-needs-get-his-facts-straight), and a look a [Verizon's latest SEC 10-K filing](http://verizon.api.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EdgarPro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?SessionID=GQYoeDso-hr2yxm&ID=11203121) seems to agree with the CEO's claim.

439,8qvwvw,False,,48,[META] Reminders and clarifications about the rules and moderation in r/NeutralPolitics,NeutralPolitics,"Dear users,

The mods here feel like it's time for some reminders about how this subreddit is run.

Primarily, as we write at the top of every post:

> /r/NeutralPolitics is a curated space. 

> In order not to get your comment removed, please familiarize yourself with our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) before you participate.

A lot of people seem to ignore this, but we're begging you… **please read the rules!**

Now, here are a few refreshers on the specifics…

**Why are sources required?**

The requirement to provide sources for all assertions of fact (Rule 2) is part of the [founding ethos of this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) Many things people believe to be true are, in fact, not. Providing sources is the best way to support your assertions. It is our cornerstone philosophy.

**How to handle requests for sources.**

Commenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith. What may seem ""obvious"" or ""common sense"" to you is often not to others. So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to support your statement, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. They're not an assault or a challenge. Think of them as an invitation to provide knowledge.

**""You can just google it.""**

No. It's the responsibility of the person making the claim to support it. It's also far more efficient for the one person making the assertion to link to the source than to charge thousands of individual readers with supporting it.

**There's no exception for ""common knowledge.""**

[This is explicitly stated in the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) because ""common knowledge"" is poorly defined and completely subjective. What qualifies as common knowledge to one person might be a shocking fact to another. For example, people who are new to a topic or are from cultures other than the dominant one in the discussion may have no idea about these supposedly ""common"" pieces of knowledge.

Additionally, statements of ""common knowledge"" are often wrong. The fact that a large number of people may believe something has [no bearing on whether or not it's true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)

We occasionally get pushback from users on this point, and it often takes the form of something like, ""Do I have to source that the sky is blue?"" This is a convenient example for a few reasons:

1. The sky is *not* blue. It only looks that way to us because of [human physiology](https://www.livescience.com/320-blue-skies-eye-beholder.html) and how the [light scatters through the atmosphere.](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/)
2. Even at that, it doesn't always appear blue. It's red and orange at sunrise and sunset, white on an overcast day, gray when there are rain clouds, and black at night.
3. Finally, this is a political discussion forum, so any assertion about the color of the sky is likely to be removed for being off topic. The same goes for similar examples, like ""water is wet."" When we get into political topics, there's actually much *less* agreement on what constitutes common knowledge, so we don't accept any of it.

**Removal reasons (we don't always post them)**

The mods try to reply with a reason for each removed comment. However, users have repeatedly complained that heavily redacted threads get crowded with removal reasons, making it hard to find the actual content. 

That in mind, there are some situations where we don't post them. The most common is when they're in a chain that is off-topic or stemming from a rule-violating comment. In that case, we'll just nuke the whole chain rather than post a dozen or so removal reasons. Comments that are just obvious trolling, spam or repeats may also be removed without notice.

What this means is that you might not notice if your comment is removed. The best way to avoid this is to not violate the [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in the first place, but if you have any doubt, you can also check the public mod logs.

**Public mod logs**

In the interest of transparency, moderation logs are public on r/NeutralPolitics. We have [our own system](https://modlogs.fyi/r/NeutralPolitics) (there's also a link in the sidebar) or you can use [ceddit](https://www.ceddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics).

Some Republican-led states with high inmate populations, like Texas and [Louisiana](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/spotlight/2017/04/14/prison-louisiana-policing-the-usa/100432314/), have also initiated reform.

In Democrat-led states, proposals focus heavily on rehabilitation. One example is a [plan for prison reform from Hawaii](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HCR-85_task_force_final_report.pdf). Excerpts:

""Evidence...confirms that the rehabilitative approach is the only sustainable way to make our communities safe,"" p. iii

""Hawai‘i should transition from a punitive to a rehabilitative correctional system,"" p. xiv

""Hawai‘i’s Correctional System Should Incorporate Key Elements of the Norwegian/European Correctional Model,"" p. 11

The [Norway model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_Norway). (It should be noted that Norway has only 5.2 million people, is not very multicultural, and has a highly educated population. Its people are pretty amendable to its criminal justice model.)

An article on the [Norway corrections model](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/18/prisonsandprobation-norway)  offers some interesting comments:

>""...two of the leading lights of European prison reform....reflect on what has allowed Norway to keep its prison population low and to generate such public support for this approach. Christie suggests that having a functioning welfare state has done a great deal, for this makes it difficult to create ""social distance"", so that each person feels connected to everyone else and therefore no one gets scapegoated for the troubles that occur.""

Can the Norway model of criminal justice be applied to the US? Is there the political will to advance the U.S. welfare state enough to effectively implement something like the Norway model?

Overall, what are the major differences between the policy proposals of the two major parties related to criminal justice reform? Given that state governments and the Federal government are divided between those parties, what's a model of criminal justice reform that suits both of them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/at7paz/regarding_criminal_justice_reform_what_are_the/,336,"The core issue I see that that there are two major, publicly traded private prison companies in the U.S.: Corrections Corp. of America (NYSE:CXW) and GEO Group (NYSE:GEO) and most people actually have their retirement accounts investing in them so if less people go to prison, people who are retired will have less income.

Some simple calculations:

$150 billion over 10 years = $15 billion per year

$15 billion / 24 million uninsured = $625 saved per person per year

Obviously this is an estimate. But supposing that it's at least roughly correct, can this be interpreted as saying that it would cost the US government $625 to insure one of those individuals for a year? This strikes me as relatively cheap, considering that [monthly premiums are roughly $393 for individuals](https://www.zanebenefits.com/blog/bid/97380/faq-how-much-does-individual-health-insurance-cost) -- so cheap that I think my line of reasoning must be flawed.

650,ejldmp,False,,98,"What effect, if any, has Trump's regulation strategy had on the increasing US emissions of 2018?",NeutralPolitics," I was doing some research on US progress on reducing emissions. From the [""Final US Emissions Estimates for 2018""](https://rhg.com/research/final-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) by Rhodium Group, 2018 saw a significant up-tick in US emissions from 2017 after 3 years of decrease. Increases were found in almost every sector: Transportation, Buildings, Power, Industry. Partial justifications for some of these increases include a colder winter--which offsets the energy savings of a cooler summer--and economic growth.

We've also seen [environmental regulations systematically removed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html) by the Trump administration. What effect do some of these regulations changes have on our emissions if any?

In addition, I noticed a curious discrepancy between the Rhodium Group's report and the EPA's reports. The EPA website only [provides data up to 2017](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2017) and an [EPA news report](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/latest-inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-shows-long-term-reductions) published in April, 2019 similarly provides insights only up to 2017. Rhodium group published their [Preliminary US Emissions Estimates for 2018](https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) in January, 2019.

Did the framers leave [the process of the impeachment trial](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) too open-ended when they allowed for the possibility of the president being acquitted without witnesses or evidence?

&#x200B;

I don't think that is an accurate telling of the current impeachment.  Should the Senate vote on the impeachment articles as voted on in the house? is a better question.  The role of the senate is not to investigate, that is the SOLE responsibility of the house.  During the clinton impeachment, the only witnesses called had already provided testimony to either the house investigation, or the special counsel.  There were no NEW witnesses. As far as the Schumer line of ""no witnesses, and no documents"" there were over 22k documents submitted for consideration, as well as the house [Report](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20191216/CRPT-116hrpt346.pdf).  But what is interesting, is Schiff has not released the testimony of one [Last Witness](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/23/michael-atkinson-testimony-concealed-adam-schiff/) from the investigation, Attkinson.   So if there is no witnesses or documents, then the house should not have voted on their articles of impeachment, because the senate is trying the case as presented by the house through the articles.  Not to mention the white house counsel was not allowed to cross examine 14 of the 18 witnesses, which on its face seems wildly inappropriate to the accused.

So I think a more neutral interpretation is, is it the responsibility of the trying body or the investigative body to conduct that portion of the impeachment?  

&#x200B;

My view is the senate should be trying the case as voted on in the house, and should not be used to complete the investigation the house chose not to, because in the case of Bolton, they KNEW they wanted him.  he is not a new player to the investigation, the house did not pursue the avenues available to them in getting Bolton to testify.

The following are the parts of the directive which I believe to be most relevant to the question of upload filters: 

>4 . If no authorisation is granted, online content-sharing service providers shall be liable for unauthorised acts of communication to the public, including making available to the public, of copyright-protected works and other subject matter, unless the service providers demonstrate that they have: 

>(a) made best efforts to obtain an authorisation, and 

>(b) made, in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence, best efforts to ensure the unavailability of specific works and other subject matter for which the rightholders have provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information; and in any event [...]

616,f8u9cp,False,,55,"Who is actually affected by the Trump administration's ""public charge"" rule?",NeutralPolitics,"First time poster, please forgive any errors in formatting.

&#x200B;

Last October, new rules regarding who would be a public charge for immigration purposes would have gone into effect, but they were blocked by several lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has recently lifted the injunction against implementing the rule  [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country)

According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:

* Supplemental Security Income;  
* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; 
* Any federal, state, local, or tribal cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called general assistance in the state context, but which may exist under other names);  
* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called food stamps); 
* Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program; 
* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);  
* Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and 
* Federally funded Medicaid (with certain exclusions). 

The rule applies to those who are seeking to adjust their status to become a legal permanent resident or certain nonimmigrants.

However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.

There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-

* Emergency medical assistance;  
* Disaster relief;  
* National school lunch programs;  
* The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;  
* The Children’s Health Insurance Program;  
* Subsidies for foster care and adoption;  
* Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans; 
* Energy assistance;  
* Food pantries and homeless shelters; and 
* Head Start.    

Certain categories of immigrants are also excluded, including refugees, asylees, T and U Visa applicants, and certain VAWA applicants.

So, my question is- Given that the vast majority of federal public benefits are off-limits to nonimmigrants, and the groups of people and types of assistance that are already not subject to the rule, who will actually be affected?

Q: Is it too late to register to vote?     
A: It depends. Some states have same-day registration. [Look up your state's information here.](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/)

Q: Where do I vote on Election Day?

Q: Do I need to show identification to vote?

Q: Where can I research what's on my ballot?     
A: Per [this recent thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9kwm02/best_website_to_get_ballot_summaries_that_are_as/) check out [BallotReady,](https://www.ballotready.org/) [OnTheIssues,](http://www.ontheissues.org/) [Ballotpedia,](https://ballotpedia.org/) [We Vote,](https://wevote.us/) or the website for your state's Secretary of State.

Q: Am I required to vote for every item on the ballot.     
A: No. Your ballot is still valid if you leave some contests without a vote.

Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?     
A: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.

> Mr. Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code — Section 6103 — that allows Congress’s tax-writing committees to view tax information on any filer. 

The provision is regularly used to sample filers to measure the impact of tax policy, and is sometimes used for investigative purposes too, however using it to seek the tax returns of the President without his or her consent has little* precedent. 

(Edit: Originally stated ""No precedent."" This is a transcription error. The NYTime's states ""little precedent"". /u/Adama0001 has more information on similar precedent.)

---

The President's personal lawyers have submitted a letter to Department of the Treasury asking the IRS to deny the request on the grounds that the Democrats don't have a suitable reason to seek the returns, and that the President's personal returns should be protected like any private citizen.

The request through 26 U.S. Code § 6103 leaves little wiggle room for the Treasury, specifically (from the 1st source):

> (f) Disclosure to Committees of Congress

I have a few questions on this topic:

1: Can the Treasury Secretary tell the IRS to deny the request, or is the code so clear the IRS must just produce the returns? 

2: If the Treasury Secretary can deny the request, must he provide a legally scrutinized justification for the denial? (Will his reasoning be the legal justification in court, or can he give a political answer?)

3: If the request for the tax returns are denied, what is the legal framing for this battle? For example, does this end up in the courts because Democrats subpoena the information, or does the codified nature of their request mean there's some non-subpoena way of resolving this issue?

The UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has defended the potential deportation of grooming gang members with dual-citizenship back to Pakistan, stripping them of their UK citizenship.

Has the UK or other countries deported criminals with dual citizenship? If they have, under what circumstances? Has something like the grooming gang scandal occurred elsewhere?

Some context on the grooming gang scandal:

[Child grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming) is befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, and sometimes the family, to lower the child's inhibitions with the objective of [sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse). Child grooming is also regularly used to lure minors into various illicit businesses such as [child trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour), [child prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prostitution), or the production of [child pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography).

[The Rotherham scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), wherein around 1,400 children ages 11-16 were sexually abused primarily by British-Pakistani men, while the authorities failed to act.

[The Telford scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telford_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), up to 1,000 children were abused in similar circumstances, with some murders as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/agxxoy/sajid_javid_defends_deportation_of_grooming_gang/,394,"I was curious about how deportation works for criminals, so I looked up the following:

https://immigration.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000784

In the United States it looks like you have two options: either have the DA drop the case and then ICE takes juristiction of the unrelated immigration matter, or the person serves their sentence and then gets deported at the end of it.

So I was confused because I was wondering why on Earth a country would want to deport someone who is so obviously at risk to the population *rather than* imprison them. That would screw over another country's population and/or allow the criminal to go free.  But it appears here that England might instead do as the US does: have him serve his sentence, then deport afterwards.

On the whole though, I think revoking citizenship is a horribly misguided and xenophobic action. A country should be made to deal with its own citizens, not pawn them off to other countries. All citizens should be treated equally. This just creates a two tiered system of citizenship: a gateway to an English version of apartheid!! ",2019-01-17 13:50:05

Mueller III is hiring a 16th member of the independent [Special Counsel investigation team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Special_Counsel_investigation).

Mueller was [appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html).

But is that really where the influence ends? Who decides how much budget he has? Can Rosenstein or anyone else influence the investigation by limiting the budget or vetoing staff hires? Or by other means like imposing an unrealistic timeline? 

How often and to whom does he have to report to make sure he's using the funds appropriately and is this an area for potential influence?

Does such a line of reporting and oversight mean someone like Rosenstein is actually privy to what Mueller has found so far and what he's planning?

Ultimately what's the effect on the independence of the investigation?

Edit: The practical questions are answered in the comments. The question remains as to how much influence this permits. Theoretically it's a lot, and it's not clear how Rosenstein's decision making can be challenged. Sessions can't, Trump won't. We're relying on Rosenstein's personal ethics (which seem to be holding up). In practice I hope that if Mueller feels he can't do a proper job he'd go public. Any thoughts?

In a year like this one, it's different.

Hillary Clinton is considered by many to be the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party because she's widely considered strong enough to defeat any and all contenders. That is based on her substantial support, especially from superdelegates. The Democrats are having a more or less textbook season.

It's a *very different story* on the Republican side. Though Trump has won a lot of support, and seems certain to win a lot more, the major powerbrokers within the party, including those in charge of the convention, broadly reject him and want him gone. And this next detail is extremely important:

*No matter what happens leading up to the convention, they can make that happen if they're really determined to.*

Though there are fussy differences in the details of how each party handles the process, both follow the same broad outlines. And one of those commonalities is that primaries are informative, but *not decisive*. How the primary season goes does not guarantee any particular outcome of the conventions which actually choose and declare the nominees.

States vary in how faithful they hold delegates, but most hold them faithful *only through the first ballot*. After that, most of them are free to vote based on their own judgement. And that's how someone like Trump can be pushed aside even if he were to win the vast majority of delegates leading up to the convention.

More, there is a little-mentioned body in pretty much all large political bodies usually called a Credentials Committee. They are the ones who *certify* the delegates, and no delegate may be seated whom they have not certified. The Credentials Committee is not answerable to delegates or states, and is not bound by primary votes or anything similar. If they reject a delegate, even if fairly elected by primary, that delegate is not seated, and will not vote at the convention.

All major parties have this device, or something that serves a similar purpose, and it's a safety check against popular insanity of the kind that elevates dangerous lunatics to power. Using it is very costly politically, and can have long-term consequences for a party that does. So it's only used very judiciously, and it's rare for qualified delegates not to be certified and seated. But if the RNC feels strongly enough that Trump is a real threat (and not only to them), they have this option.

So the reason Trump is not being called presumptive is that GOP leadership mostly opposes him, no matter how popular he may be among rank and file Republicans.

When reading this over, nothing really concrete stood out to me that this EO was really accomplishing. Maybe I missed some of the nuance or how this EO will play with existing laws?

Section 2 says this: ""In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury""
Maybe I'm getting lost on the long sentence structure, but it sounds like it's saying the DoT will not take adverse action against religious organizations when they talk about politics where that speech is not ordinarily treated as political campaigning. But it also says consistent with law. So what does that really mean? Isn't it already against the law for religious organizations to use funds to campaign? So what does this section really change?

Section 3 (Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate) seemed the most concrete, but the language is written as ""shall consider"" - meaning that they don't have to implement anything from this EO.

The two [mentioned](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/180/) [rulings](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/622/) as far as I can tell relate to cable providers being required to air [locally licensed stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System,_Inc._v._FCC)

I guess he is referencing the fact television companies were first amendment speakers but if he is saying the FCC cant apply the 1934 communication act because the internet is not ""radio"" how can he apply case law from the supreme court on a ruling about cable? If anything it would seem to me the internet is more analogous to radio than T.V.?

Because newspapers are economically finite enterprises, ""editors may conclude that the safe course is to avoid controversy,"" thereby chilling speech. Furthermore, the Court held the exercise of **editorial judgment** is a protected First Amendment activity. In effect, this ruling reaffirmed the constitutional principle of freedom of the press (detailed in the First Amendment) and prevented state governments from controlling the content of the press

Again why is a supreme court ruling on newspapers being applied as case law to the internet? Does that require some interpretation of the supreme courts intention that he seems to imply in his own dissent he cannot do?

413,4tfffg,False,,110,Would Turkey Be Justified in Kidnapping or Drone-Killing Fethullah Gulen in Pennsylvania?,NeutralPolitics,"Good morning everyone. I lifted the subject of this discussion directly from [an article by Glenn Greenwald that appears this morning on *The Intercept.*](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/18/would-turkey-be-justified-in-kidnapping-or-drone-killing-the-turkish-cleric-in-pennsylvania/) 

To summarize- in this article Greenwald argues a kind of moral equivalence between the United States' use of military drones to kill suspected terrorists in the ME and a hypothetical action by Turkey to assassinate Fathullah Gulen in Pennsylvania. (Gulen is the cleric Erdogan claims is responsible for Friday's failed military coup in Turkey. He has been living in the USA since 1999, despite repeated requests by Erdogan that he be extradited.)

Greenwald concludes his article with a harsh rebuke of what he describes as an American ""pathology"":

>U.S. drone kills of terror suspects (including its own citizens) are extremely popular among Americans, including (in the age of Obama) those who self-identify as liberal Democrats. Yet it’s virtually certain that Americans across the ideological spectrum would explode in nationalistic outrage if Turkey actually did the same thing in Pennsylvania... 

> Indeed, so ingrained is this pathology that the mere suggestion that the U.S. should be subject to the same laws and rules as everyone else inevitably provokes indignant accusations that the person is guilty of the greatest sin: comparing the United States of America to the lesser, inferior governments and countries of the world.

So clearly this is a pretty provocative piece of writing, which not only touches on the news of the day but also addresses a persistent undercurrent in the national debate regarding how the United States should prosecute the offensive against terrorists abroad. 

Here is some background reading that might be helpful:

- The lawyer they met with:

>The Russian lawyer invited to the Trump Tower meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is best known for mounting a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Mr. Putin that he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children.

- The lawyer's ties:

>Ms. Veselnitskaya was formerly married to a former deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region, and her clients include state-owned businesses and a senior government official’s son, whose company was under investigation in the United States at the time of the meeting. Her activities and associations had previously drawn the attention of the F.B.I., according to a former senior law enforcement official.

- The topic of discussion:

>In his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said: 'It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.'

When a joint resolution terminating a national emergency is introduced in either chamber, it is referred to an appropriate committee, which is obligated to report it out with any recommendations within 15 calendar days. The House or Senate is then obligated to vote on the proposal within three calendar days. If one chamber passes a resolution, it is then passed to the other chamber, where the same basic procedures apply. If the two chambers pass different versions of a joint resolution, then a conference committee is obligated to file a compromise report within six days, which then must be voted on within an additional six days. If they cannot come to agreement, they must report that back within 48 hours. **The net effect of these procedures is to ensure that joint resolutions to terminate national emergencies will receive at least some manner of vote (procedural or substantive) in both chambers, regardless of the preferences of House or Senate leadership or any filibusters by Senate members.**

From there, President Trump will have the option to Veto the resolution, which would send it back to the House and Senate where 2/3 majorities in both chambers will be required to overrule Trump's veto (from 2nd source):

> ...a joint resolution ending a national emergency is still subject to a veto by the president.

A Joint Resolution to overturn a Presidential Emergency Declaration is an exception to the general rules.

This leaves me very confused about what rules dictate a forced vote in the Senate when the President vetos a Joint Resolution to overturn an Emergency Declaration. For example, if a Joint Resolution passes in the House and Senate, the President vetos that JR, does the Senate *have* to vote on overruling that veto?

I have two questions:

1: Does the Senate *have* to hold votes on overturning a Presidential veto? Is there anything different about a Joint Resolution to overturn a Presidential Emergency Declaration that would force a vote on overturning *that* Presidential veto?

2: If there is a dispute as to whether or not the chamber is forced to vote, how is that conflict resolved? 

---

**Edit: If I could add this question:**

**This Joint Resolution, should it be passed in the House, seems like a fairly unique procedure to force a Senate floor vote. Are there any other odd procedures relating to any topic that would force a Senate floor vote like this?**
",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/as4tc4/the_senate_generally_has_the_right_to_decide_for/,478,"Barring a judicial order, I don't think the Senate has to schedule a vote on the Joint Resolution, even though the Act specifically states that it does, because it's impossible to enforce with Mitch McConnell as the Majority Whip.  He's already clarified his support (or possible indifference) for President Trump's invocation of executive emergency powers through the National Emergencies Act.^[1](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-border-wall-presidential-powers-trump-national-emergency-0218-20190215-story.html)  

>Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution is unequivocal: ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law."" But, according to reports, Trump will spend around $8 billion for a barrier at the border, only $1.375 billion of which is in Congress's new budget deal. That's something the late, great Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., would never have choked down. **McConnell, on the other hand, already said that he is willing to swallow it.**

The Senate will vote on whatever bill the majority leader and other senior party members permit on the floor, which stems from the Senate's own rules of procedure^[2](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/floor_leaders.htm) and their traditional unwritten legislative precedent.  Both houses are constitutionally permitted to establish their own rules of procedure.^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_2:_Rules)  The Senate and House of Representatives intermittently attempted to establish joint rules of operation, but gave up by 1889, opting instead to rely on provisions of legislation or informal understandings (legislative precedent).^[4](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Getting_Together_-_Joint_Rules_of_House_and_Senate.htm)  The threshold for a successful Congressional Veto of a Presidential Veto is two-thirds of both houses of Congress, and according to *INS v Chadha*^[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service_v._Chadha), the bicameralism principle of the Constitution cannot be altered legislatively in such a manner as to sidestep that threshold; therefore, I suspect the House and Senate would both be required to vote if Congress wishes to overturn the Presidential Veto of the Joint Resolution with a Congressional one.  The Senate cannot act on behalf of the House of Representatives to overturn a Presidential Veto by itself because it's a separate institution with different responsibilities; neither chamber possesses the constitutional authority or even statutory means to formally punish each other individually.  Due in no small part to Mitch McConnell's support of President Trump's emergency declaration pursuant to existing law, I doubt the Senate will ever (even if it's politically pressured by the House) agree to a Congressional Veto.  From there, if a suit (or suits) follow, many legal questions will arise and perhaps the constitutionality of Trump's emergency declaration won't be discussed at all.     

>As identified in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), a political question may arise when any one of the following circumstances is present:
""a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or **a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it**; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.""^[6](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep369/usrep369186/usrep369186.pdf) [*see page 217*].

If any one of the above categories are met, the courts might determine the issue to be nonjusticiable, which would end their involvement.  I don't see how they could resolve the Joint Resolution problem by creating a manageable standard because, apart from both Houses agreeing to passing a J.R pursuant with their respective rules, the Senate could simply refuse to do this.  As per the National Emergencies Act of 1976^[7](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg1255.pdf):

>(4) In the case of any disagreement between the two Houses of Congress with respect to a ~~concurrent resolution~~ joint resolution passed by both Houses, conferees shall be promptly appointed and the committee of conference shall make and file a report with respect to such concurrent resolution within six calendar days after the day on which managers on the part of the Senate and the House have been appointed. Notwithstanding any rule in either House concerning the printing of conference reports or concerning any delay in the consideration of such reports, such report shall be acted on by both Houses not later than six calendar days after the conference report is filed in the House in which such report is filed first. In the event the conferees are unable to agree within forty-eight hours, they shall report back to their respective Houses in disagreement.
(5) Paragraphs (l)-(4) of this subsection, subsection (b) of this section, and section 502(b) of this Act are enacted by Congress-- 
(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the House in the case of resolutions described by this subsection; and they supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and (B) with **full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House)** at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House... 

In the original Act, they utilized a concurrent resolution because that requires only Congressional approval notwithstanding the President's approval or disapproval (meaning that the President cannot veto it), but because C.R's lack the force of law, Congress can't terminate a national emergency with one. National Emergencies made pursuant to existing law [particularly when one considers *INS v Chadha*] necessitate a joint resolution; thus, they altered the law and replaced the words concurrent with joint.^[8](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-99/pdf/STATUTE-99-Pg405.pdf#page=44)

>**Bills:** The principal vehicle employed by lawmakers for introducing their proposals (enacting or repealing laws, for example) in the Senate. Bills are designated S. 1, S. 2, and so on depending on the order in which they are introduced. They address either matters of general interest (""public bills"") or narrow interest (""private bills"").
**Joint Resolution:** Designated ""S. J. Res."" and numbered consecutively upon introduction, with one exception it requires the approval of both chambers and is submitted (just as a bill) to the president for possible signature into law. The one exception is that joint resolutions are used to propose constitutional amendments. These resolutions require a two-thirds affirmative vote in each house but are not submitted to the president; they become effective when ratified by three-quarters of the States.
**Concurrent Resolution:** Designated ""S. Con. Res."" and numbered consecutively upon introduction is generally employed to address the sentiments of both chambers, to deal with issues or matters affecting both houses, or to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not submitted to the president and thus do not have the force of law.^[9](https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/d_three_sections_with_teasers/bills.htm)

I'm of the opinion that, in the event of a conflict between both houses regarding a vote, politics is the only solution.

Can a President set such conditions on Congressional approved aid?

As such, the moderation team felt compelled to provide some guidelines to assist all participants in developing their own fact-based understanding of the COVID-19 outbreak.

***What is COVID-19 and what symptoms does it cause?*** 

COVID-19 is a [viral infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) caused by a member of a family of large viruses known as coronavirus. Originally isolated to Wuhan,China, the illness has now been reported in [118 countries across all major continents](https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/c88e37cfc43b4ed3baf977d77e4a0667). 

Symptoms appear to occur within [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) after initial exposure, with [one study](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) suggesting an average incubation period of 5.1 days. It is possible to be infected with the COVID-19 virus but not show any symptoms of illness, a state known as asymptomatic infection. Asymptomatic infection is considered relatively rare and early data suggests that asymptomatic viral shedding [does not appear to be a driver of infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Most symptoms are generally mild and begin gradually but include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 

Currently the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) or R0 (pronounced R-naught or R-zero) is estimated to be anywhere from [2.0](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). The R0, which is not a fixed value, is thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. For context, the R0 for the seasonal flu is estimated at [1.28](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) while the 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak R0 was at 1.46 and 1.48.  While most cases are mild, [early reports from China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) indicated that 16% of COVID-19 cases were severe and as of March 11th COVID-19 mortality rates are 3.4% globally.

It's worth noting that early data is often [incomplete and can be misleading](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/), with [many experts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mortality/why-covid-19-death-rates-are-not-what-they-seem-idUSKBN20Z281) expressing [caution over](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-mortality-rates-covid-19-misleading-experts/story?id=69477312) over early reported data.


***COVID-19 Myths and Fact Checking***

As with any developing story, [myths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) are common. Many health agencies and organizations [like the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html) or the [American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/communicable-disease/coronavirus) have published simple COVID-19 fact sheets that may be used to verify claims. 


As a general practice it's always good to consider the source, history, evidence, emotion, and pictures (or [SHEEP)](https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/5-tips-ways-we-can-all-covid19-check-coronavirus-information-online-fake-disinformation-misinformation/) of a source. Tools like Google's [Fact Checker Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer) and Poynter's [International Fact Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/media-news/fact-checking/) may provide additional context. 

***Where can I find the current status of the outbreak?***

The WHO is currently publishing daily [situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). These reports include global morbidity (the state of having the disease) and mortality (death from the disease) counts.  

***How can I protect myself?***

While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. Fortunately, there are [many basic protective measures](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) an individual can take to reduce their chance of COVID-19 infection.

* Frequent Hand Washing for at [least 20 seconds](https://ew.com/music/coronavirus-covid-19-hand-wash-songs/)
* Maintain a proper social distance of at least 1 meter or 3 feet between you and others
* Avoid touching your face
* Stay at home if you're not feeling well
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance to avoid unnecessarily overwhelming local health systems
* Follow the directions of your local health authority. 

If traveling locally or abroad, relevant travel guidelines may exist.

- What about the [mystery company](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/supreme-court-mystery-grand-jury-subpoena-mueller/index.html) that may appeal to the supreme court?

- Is this actually the end of the Mueller Investigation or will the office continue to operate to some degree beyond wrapping up trials?

- What procedure or precedent can compel that the report be made [""sight unseen""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sight%20unseen) to promote transparency and bipartisanship in the publication of information?

565,b1uxfi,False,,350,What are the causes of California's housing shortage? What steps can they take to address the shortage?,NeutralPolitics,"Back in 1978, before California's housing boom, the Californian people passed [Proposition 13](https://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf) which rolled back and froze property tax values to the 1976 assessed value. Property tax increases were also limited to no more than 2% per year as long as the property was not sold. When the house was sold the property was reassessed at 1% of the sale price. It now seems that with the increasing housing prices we are seeing a spike in out-migration from California, as per this study from [California's Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265), between the years 2007 to 2016 the state lost a new 1 million residents. Now despite the fact that it is now cheaper to hold onto land as opposed to selling it, and sky rocketing home prices( [With California's median home price now topping $600,000) as per the California Association of Realtors](https://www.car.org/en/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2018releases/May2018homesales)) , why is it that we aren't seeing a co-equal influx in housing construction in California to meet the 180,000 needed annual construction of new homes ([as per a 2018 study from California's Housing Future: Challenges and Opportunities the amount of newly constructed homes only averaged less than 80,000 homes annually](http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/sha_final_combined.pdf))",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/b1uxfi/what_are_the_causes_of_californias_housing/,432,"> why is it that we aren't seeing a co-equal influx in housing construction in California to meet the 180,000 needed annual construction of new homes

California's housing crisis is a case of demand far outstripping whatever supply can bring to bear.  Most people want to live in the LA and SF areas, as evidenced by the [gigantic sprawls](https://la.curbed.com/2014/4/3/10121264/los-angeles-sprawl-history-map-animation) that have erupted from [both places](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/31/new-report-shows-huge-gains-in-bay-area-open-space-but-nearly-300000-acres-still-at-risk/), but as one branches out the territory becomes far less desirable than the metro areas proper, which makes new construction in these areas less desirable.

What is causing the demand?  That's hard to answer.  I'm of the opinion that the combination of Silicon Valley, LA's booming port and rail industry due to pacific rim trade, and foreign buying have dramatically altered the housing costs to something less than rational for the average person looking to work and raise a family somewhere.

http://www.joshuakennon.com/thoughts-bernie-sanders-tax-economic-proposal/

From the perspective of someone without much formal background in tax or economics, it seems to bring up a lot of fair points: 

> ""An estimated 45% of the tax revenue Sanders wants to raise comes from these offensive and onerous levies on working families, not the rich alone.""

> ""if you are self-employed, before we’ve even gotten to the other tax changes he wants to make, you are now looking at sending more than 1/5th of your income to the Federal government and you still wouldn’t have paid a penny of Federal, state, or local income taxes, sales taxes, or property taxes.""
> 
> ""By the time all is said and done, even accounting for the supposed free college and health care that Sanders is promising his voters, the discretionary purchasing power of nearly every family in this country, rich and poor alike, would be lowered, in some cases by double-digit percentages.""


It's a bit of a long read (with a big ""preamble""), and there are many more criticisms than what I quoted here. 

So my question - are these legitimate, well-founded criticisms or is there some bias, hyperbole or exaggeration in here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4ckzoh/evaluation_of_this_criticism_of_sanders_tax_plan/,336,"I find this blog post a bit disingenuous.

From WaPO article:

>The power to pardon is granted to the president in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, which gives the commander in chief the power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” That means pardon authority extends to federal criminal prosecution but not to state level or impeachment inquiries.

>No president has sought to pardon himself, so no courts have reviewed it. Although Kalt says the weight of the law argues against a president pardoning himself, he says the question is open and predicts such an action would move through the courts all the way to the Supreme Court.

[U.S. Const. art. II, § 2 in full](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii)

So my question is, since the president's power to pardon himself has never been reviewed by the federal courts, what are the constitutional arguments both for and against the president having the power to pardon himself?

The common belief that Trump has ties with Russia is the ""comrade"" relationship. A sort of 'let me build on boardwalk and I'll give you the railroads' type of thing. Becoming president seems like a stretch to accomplish that when you could just lobby like every other industry does but I digress.

The type of relationship trumps lawyer spoke of was a diplomatic relationship, like all world leaders have with each other and is not at all unusual. Obama had a diplomatic relationship with Russia.

> Using a variety of methods to analyze employment in
all sectors paying below a specified real hourly rate, we conclude that the second wage increase
to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by around 9 percent, while hourly wages in such
jobs increased by around 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll fell for such jobs, implying that the minimum wage ordinance lowered low-wage employees’ earnings by an average of $125 per month in 2016

A $1500 annual reduction (or 6.6%) in pay for someone making ~~minimum wage~~ less than $19/hour seems like a big hit. Did this policy end up hurting a demographic of society that it was intended to help?

For those who are confused, the Constitution splits up power between three branches of government.  The Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial.  Each one has *enumerated* powers, meaning powers explicitly written into the Constitution for that branch to exercise.  In theory, this would help stop the concentration of power into one branch.  However, overtime, Congress has delegated powers to the Executive branch (as well as to its independent agencies) to carry out laws created by the Legislative branch; these powers are sometimes referred to as apart of the ""Administrative State"".

Originally Amazon was set to receive some $3 billion in government incentives, but pushback had been mounting over a successful company receiving such credits (in 3rd source):

> Amazon on Thursday canceled its plans to build an expansive corporate campus in New York City after facing an unexpectedly fierce backlash from some lawmakers and union leaders, who contended that a tech giant did not deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives.

Amazon put out a statement highlighting the pushback (in 3rd source):

> “A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward,’’ Amazon said in a statement.

The New York Times states this is a negative for both the Governor of New York State and Mayor of New York City (in 3rd source):

> The company’s decision is a major blow for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had set aside their differences to bring the company to New York.

I have a few questions trying to understand what was originally offered to Amazon, and what political actions were taken before they ultimately pulled out:

1: What specific incentives was Amazon set to receive for building its New York campus? Were the incentives Federal, State, or Local, and in what share?

2: In their decision not to build, Amazon makes reference to opposition by State and Local politicians. Specifically, what opposition are they talking about? Was there any legislative action in the works at either State or Local levels to change the terms that were offered to Amazon originally?

3: Amazon also states that with Local and State politicians they would not be able to ""...build the type of relationships that are required to go forward."" Beyond the initial $3 billion in incentives, has Amazon stated what type of additional support or help they would need from politicians, as this statement implies?

In my questions below, and in my title of this post, when I reference the ""Black Lives Matter organization"" (which I admit is a misnomer, though I'll leave the questions unedited for transparency), I mean specifically Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., and I'm curious about what they've accomplished with respect to policy. I take full responsibility for the confusion, and I apologize.

In the wake of [George Floyd's death](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/30/video-timeline-george-floyd-death/), the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" has been a part of [celebrity social media posts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/11/celebrities-black-lives-matter-movement/), [official corporate communications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/13/after-years-marginalizing-black-employees-customers-corporate-america-says-black-lives-matter/), and [art on the streets of a few US cities](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/12/the-standoff-over-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-mural-illustrated/).

Likewise, donations to groups that focus on combating issues around racial prejudice and race-based inequities have reportedly skyrocketed. Specifically, according to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/14/us/politics/black-lives-matter-racism-donations.html) in the New York Times: 

> ""ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic

> ever came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250
> million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus
> weeks, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation
> ticker.""

That being said, some organizations are more forthcoming about what their funds are responsible for than others. For example, [the NAACP's organizational history page](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/) describes their involvement in the processes of the ""integration of the armed forces in 1948 but also passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.""

The Black Lives Matter website, however, gives far less information than those of comparable organizations. The group's pages within their ""About"" section dedicated to their history as an organization (namely the ""[About Black Lives Matter,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/)"" ""[6 Years Strong,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/six-years-strong/)"" and ""[Herstory,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/)"" pages) all mention the group's formation in 2013-2014, but they don't mention any other significant dates important to the group, or policy successes that the group was responsible for. The only place on the website which does list significant dates and initiatives seems to be the site's [Global Actions page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/), which as of posting has not been updated beyond February 2019 (here is a link to the Wayback Machine's [snapshot of this page c.

I'm a graduate student myself (in a STEM field), so this topic is of some personal importance to me. However, I have yet to find a news article that details exactly how this is supposed to work. The NYT opinion piece quoted above references that the bill repeals Section 117(d)(5) of the tax code, but that's as specific as I've seen journalists get. It's rare (read: nonexistant) for such pieces to quote directly from the bill or the tax code and no attempt at real legal analysis is ever made.

I call attention to this fact because there was some good discussion on /r/gradschool recently about this bill and there was one (heavily downvoted) user who was unsure that the tax bill would actually have this result. I found [this analysis](https://surlysubgroup.com/2017/11/06/gop-raises-taxes-on-graduate-students-or-does-it/) by a professor at Notre Dame Law School who goes into some detail as to how the bill and tax code interact and he seems similarly unsure. To quote:

> According to Dr. Wilke, the GOP tax bill now requires those tuition waivers to be included in income. After studying the bill and the current statute, this appeared to be true. So, I ran the numbers for a typical graduate student at my institution. You can read my in-depth calculation in the Twitter thread. But essentially, of the $23,000 stipend that a single Notre Dame student receives, he or she would need to pay approximately $13,350 in federal and state income tax, compared with about $2,500 under current law. That makes a graduate education effectively unaffordable.

> Perhaps I’m naïve, but I have trouble believing that the GOP really intends to take away such a large, important benefit from a huge number of students, whose work is critically important to the betterment of this country. Could the GOP have meant only to target the other provisions in section 117(d), which exclude undergraduate tuition waivers from taxation for employees of a university? Are there remaining provisions in the Code that could save the tuition waiver’s tax-free nature? Let’s take a closer look at the proposal.

He goes into some detail in his analysis, but ... it's complicated. I'm not sure I have understood him well enough to summarize accurately, and so I encourage you to simply read his article.

Does anyone here have any insight as to what exactly is going on with Section 1204(a)(3) and how exactly tuition waivers are handled under Section 117 of the [tax code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/117)? I have found mainstream journalism to be incredibly unhelpful in this regard.

From this, one could infer that more than half of the hourly workforce is past the point that a job paying higher than minimum would be expected, i.e. 'work experience,' with [most salaried workers receiving a three percent raise annually](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0516/Pages/0516-fair-compensation.aspx).

One of the many [chief arguments opposing a wage increase](http://www.aei.org/publication/ten-reasons-economists-object-to-the-minimum-wage/) is that increasing such a wage may drive retailers to increase their prices to recoup the costs, defeating the purpose of a wage increase if said increase is to amp up the spending power of the labor class.

However, [as anecdotally reported by CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/adjusted-for-inflation-the-federal-minimum-wage-is-worth-less-than-50-years-ago.html) in the case of a Pennsylvania-based restaurant chain's $1.50 wage increase to minimum wage workers, spending power of the restaurant owner's employees was increased while his profits remained relatively unaffected, inferred by him to be because the employees were able to spend more money both at his restaurants as well as in other local chains.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5tjduv/what_does_current_evidence_and_analysis_say_about/,502,[removed] ,2017-02-12 03:29:14

What specific parts of his agenda have not been accomplished because of it?",NeutralPolitics,"With the end of Barack Obama's term in sight, in retrospectives and other articles trying to tally up the achievements and asking the question 'what will be the legacy of eight years of Obama', I keep seeing this phrase or variations thereof:

**Obama could have accomplished more, if not for the *unprecedented obstruction* by Republicans**

Examples:

>There's not enough space in this column to list all the many ways the GOP obstructed Obama.

>Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010, Obama used executive power

http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/09/opinions/obama-legacy-opinion-roundup/

Elizabeth Warren even went so far as to argue that obstructionism “has created a breeding ground for new and dangerous Republican extremism” that “encourage[s] even more outrageous behavior from other Republican leaders” and “is on display in the 2016 election.” More specifically, she claimed that Republicans “have consistently blocked President Obama’s judicial nominees.”

Jesse Jackson:

>He did all of this while facing unprecedented, unrelenting partisan obstruction, with the Republican leader of the Senate opposing him at every turn, intent on making him a one-term president. In part because of that opposition, much remained undone. The stimulus would have been larger and the recovery stronger except for Republican opposition. The national minimum wage would have been raised. A national infrastructure project to rebuild America would have been launched. Progress on making America the leader of the green revolution, the next global industrial revolution, would have been greater. Guantanamo, the shameful prison in Cuba, would have been closed. The Voting Rights Act would have been revived, and much more.

Some even specifically blamed 'white men':

>And it is clear that he has been obstructed at every turn by white men on the right who have offered temper tantrums instead of leadership. But it is also clear that the president could have done more.

Even Bill Clinton used the phrase:

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/03/21/bill-clinton-knocks-obamas-awful-legacy/82094792/

>After President Obama was elected, Republicans made it their number one goal to block him at every turn,"" spokesman Angel Urena said in a statement. ""That unprecedented obstruction these last eight years is their legacy, and the American people should reject it by electing Hillary Clinton to build on President Obama's success so we can all grow and succeed together.""

Some other mentions of the phrase I have found either vaguely referencing how it prevented his legacy, or how it's unique to the GOP (""GOP-style""), use it to explain why he 'hasn't accomplished much' etc.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/the-wreckage-of-obamas-legacy.html

But others have disputed obstruction and the unprecedented nature ascribed to it:

http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2016/12/behold-the-lefts-manufactured-hysteria-about-gop-obstruction-of-judicial-nominees

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/opinion/sunday/eight-was-enough.html

>For others, the culprit is the Republican Party, which obstructed Mr. Obama at every turn. And for still others, like Mr. Obama, the problem is that his administration didn’t do enough to advertise its greatness. Even if you believe there are elements of truth in these explanations, they still amount to excuses.

Or have even argued that obstruction made him *more* powerful: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/barack-obama-gop-most-powerful-213814


**Was Obama obstructed, and if yes**:

**a)** was this to an *historically unprecedented* degree, and if not unprecedented: is this unique to *Republican* lawmakers or have Democrats done the same thing in the past?

**b)** What -specific-  parts of Obama's agenda have not been accomplished could reasonably be blamed on *Republican obstruction*?

What are the house rules on closed-door hearings and who can enter those?

572,923ne7,False,,107,[META] Updates to the rules in r/NeutralPolitics,NeutralPolitics,"Dear users,

Today we're announcing a few small updates to the rules and procedures. Some of these were already mod policy, but hadn't been added to the official guidelines yet. Others are new.


**1. The table in the [sources section of the guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) has two new lines to deal with personal blogs and tweets:**

Source type | Submissions | Comments
---|---|----
Personal blogs* | Disallowed | Permitted if the blog post links to qualified non-blog sources
Tweets | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder

This means tweets may not be used to support any assertion of fact other than a claim of attribution. For instance, a [tweet from the NeutralPolitics Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NeutralPolitic/status/1022531083341058048) saying, ""NeutralPolitics has the best looking mods on all of Reddit!"" cannot be used to support assertions about the attractiveness of the mods. It can only be used to demonstrate that the NeutralPolitics mod team *stated* it has the most attractive mods (even though it happens to be true).

 \*A personal blog is defined as a blog with any one of the following characteristics: only has one contributor, allows anonymous contributors without editorial oversight, doesn't have a masthead.

**2. Users may not post top-level comments on their own submissions.** Such comments will be automatically removed.

The review process for submissions is strict and detailed in NeutralPolitics. The mods view top-level comments by submitters as a way to circumvent that process, adding content that would not have been approved under the submission rules. Submitters are free to participate in the discussion as replies to other users.

**3. Submissions asking whether something is ""unusual"" (and other variations using that word) are no longer allowed.** They are considered non-specific and leading, and as such, violate submission rules A and B. 

 Submitters may still pose questions that examine historical standards and expectations in any of the following more evidence-based forms:

* Is there historical precedent for x?
* What are some examples of when x has happened before?
* In what ways, if any, does x break from historical norms?
* What legal/political/historical basis is there for X to be considered?

**3. Links that redirect from Google are now allowed**, so long as they don't disguise the final destination in the URL (e.g., https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-california-pension-liabilities-20180118-story.html). Other redirecting links are still prohibited.

**4. After a [16-month hiatus,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5xr3xn/meta_rneutralpolitics_is_opting_out_of_rall_and/) r/NeutralPolitics has returned to r/all on a trial basis.** As always, this runs the risk of attracting participants who don't follow the rules, so we remind our long-time users that the mods rely on reports to find comments that are in violation.

**5. Our sister subreddit, r/NeutralNews, needs more mods and submitters.** See [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/91srzl/meta_call_for_mods_and_feedback_summer_2018/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/923ne7/meta_updates_to_the_rules_in_rneutralpolitics/,427,"I'm a bit confused by number 2.

A few specific questions:

* What is the precedent for a Congressional investigation to subpoena documents from an internet/telecom company that stores them rather than from the person they belong to?
* Can Congress issue a broad subpoena to a company asking for all data from a government official's personal accounts that might be relevant to their investigation?

Overall the purpose of this seems to be that they believe Twitter is considered a “designated public forum” for 1st amendment purposes.

The National Football League (NFL) recently issued [new rules regarding athlete behavior during the national anthem,](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533/nfl-owners-approve-new-national-anthem-policy) specifically requiring present athletes to stand while it's being played, but allowing those who object to remain in the locker room until the anthem concludes. There are fines associated with violations of these rules.

Political protest is a [Constitutionally guaranteed right in the US,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) but many [legal experts support the view](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/25/16360580/nfl-donald-trump-national-anthem-protest) that the NFL, as a private organization, may set its own workplace rules, even if they limit expression. 

On the other hand, there are some interesting counterarguments.

> Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in *Beckman v. Chicago Bear Football Club* that a Green Bay Packers fan [may proceed with his First Amendment lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2018/05/02/recent-court-decision-makes-it-riskier-for-nfl-teams-to-punish-protesting-players/#354cee8948d8) against the Chicago Bears organization after the Bears refused to allow him to attend an on-field event while dressed in Packers clothing. The court noted that the fan may have a right to ""free speech"" within Soldier Field based on an operating agreement that gave both the Chicago Bears football club and the Chicago Park District shared control over speech in the **publicly-funded football stadium.** (emphasis added)

[Many NFL stadiums are publicly funded.](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-new-stadiums-public-funding-how-much-atlanta-san-diego-minnesota-los-angeles-033116)

And Benjamin Sachs, a Harvard professor of labor and industry, [calls the ban ""flatly illegal""](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/25/17394422/nfl-knee-kneeling-labor-law-kaepernick-free-speech-protest-owners) on a number of different grounds, including the league's failure to discuss the new rules with the player's union before changing the terms of employment, the restriction it imposes on the employees' right to engage in a collective action, and the limitations it introduces on protected free speech, based on either State constitutions, or Federally, because of the involvement of the US President in the dispute.

So, the first question is, based on the above, whether the NFL's new policy is legal.

Moving beyond that, is the ban an appropriate measure for the league to take? President Trump expressed his support for the rule and strongly implied that it didn't go far enough:

> I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or
you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.

Others argue that in the US, [the act of protest itself is patriotic.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-anthem-nfl-protest-patriotism-20180524-story.html) Is there room for dissent over policy at a public event put on by a private organization?

And finally, if the NFL's new policy isn't the right one, what would be better? Have alternative approaches been proposed that would allow the league to respond to the desires of its fans while also honoring the laws and traditions of the country?

508,6ohgoj,False,,37,What evidence exists to support the claim that the long-term benefit of repatriation of American manufacturing outweighs the immediate higher costs and will spur higher growth?,NeutralPolitics,"Yesterday Peter Navarro (the White House Trade Council director) [was on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/19/538148732/white-house-trade-council-director-touts-made-in-america-week), making an argument for the repatriation of American manufacturing.  I'm going to take this point by point here:

>NAVARRO: Well, I think you start with the idea that we've had 15 years of subpar growth - 2 percent or below. Prior to 2001, we grew at 3 and a half percent. The big difference has been the entry of China in particular into the World Trade Organization and our markets. And we've just been hammered. What that does as a proxy basically is it drains essentially the lifeblood out of our manufacturing economy, out of our communities, out of our tax bases.

The first part of this statement [may be an exaggeration](https://www.thebalance.com/us-gdp-by-year-3305543), but [one study](https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/china-paper.pdf) suggests that:

>Conservatively, it [rising Chinese import competition] explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in exposed labor markets.

However, [other economists dispute](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21718513-china-shock-has-not-been-debunked-it-worth-understanding) at least some of these claims, arguing that studying the effects of extra Chinese supply  in isolation rather than in conjunction with something happening in America over-inflates the purported effect on the labor market.  Still [others argue](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19376.pdf) that the net welfare benefit to the US of stopping free trade with China would roughly be equal to the benefit gained by cheaper Chinese imports.

**Is the US-Chinese Trade deficit a significant factor in the decline of American manufacturing & growth?  Is it balanced by the benefit of cheaper imported goods for consumers?**

Navarro further goes on to assert that:

>What's interesting is that with every different country that we have a large trade deficit with, we have a different set of problems - with Mexico, for example - cheap labor. With Germany, they have a misaligned currency. So if you address these issues of unfair trade practices, if you get better trade deals, if you stop things like forced technology transfer or the theft of our intellectual property, if you ensure that the sweatshops of the world live up to international standards for minimum wage and safe working conditions, if you have reasonable environmental protection, then American manufacturers can compete with anybody in the world.

This is a very broad set of issues.  Focusing on worker compensation, the [Fair Labor Association states](http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/toward_fair_compensation_in_global_supply_chains_2016_report_only_0.pdf) reports that even when there are no legal violations in pay for workers in third world countries, the ""purchasing power of the current legal [wage] minimum falls below or near the World Bank poverty line"".  Additionally, the US has several trade agreements with [legally enforceable environmental protections](https://www.state.gov/e/oes/eqt/trade/).  My question here is:

**What measures currently exist to correct inequalities (wages/labor, environmental, intellectual property, etc.) between US manufacturers and those abroad and are they enforceable?**

Further, **what further protections would be necessary to enable ""American manufacturers to compete with anybody in the world""?**

Finally, Navarro argues:

>NAVARRO: Let me give you a number of answers to that. I mean first of all, a lot of the goods that come from abroad which are, quote, ""cheaper"" basically are cheaper because state-owned enterprises have made them heavily subsidized by their government, and they're dumped into our markets. Number two, if you look at this as a movie rather than a snapshot and you buy American in our government procurement policy - let's say it costs a little bit more - but what do you get for that?
...
What I'm saying is that if something looks like it costs a little more just 'cause it's made in America, when you cost it all out the benefits over time far outweigh the costs. Think about this. Over the last 15 years what has been the cost of buying all those cheap goods? We've lost trillions in terms of our tax base, and we put millions of people out of work.

The [Harvard business review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-chinese-subsidies-changed) supports the first part of Navarro's statement:

>In the Chinese industries we studied — solar, steel, glass, paper, and auto parts — labor was between 2% and 7% of production costs, and imported raw materials and energy accounted for most costs. Production mostly came from small companies that possessed no scale economies. Yet, Chinese products routinely sold for 25% to 30% less than those from the U.S. or European Union.

>We found that Chinese companies could do this only because of subsidies they received from China’s central and provincial governments. The subsidies took the form of free or low-cost loans; artificially cheap raw materials, components, energy, and land; and support for R&D and technology acquisitions.

>Since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, subsidies have annually financed over 20% of the expansion of the country’s manufacturing capacity. The state has willingly paid the price of economic inefficiency to accomplish political, social, economic, and diplomatic goals. Huge Chinese subsidies have led to massive excess global capacity, increased exports, and depressed worldwide prices, and have hollowed out other countries’ industrial bases.

as does the [American Enterprise Institute](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-importance-of-chinese-subsidies/), but further states:

>The harm is usually identified as large-scale U.S. imports from China. In fact, the main problems are barriers to American exports to the PRC and, perhaps soon, a growing battle in third markets. For the last decade, Beijing has acted as if competition is good for everyone except Chinese firms on their home turf.

**Does the current evidence suggest that imports of subsidized foreign goods are laregly responsible for slowing American growth, or is the problem instead barriers to American exports (or both/neither)?**

**Would the benefits of policies to protect American manufacturing indeed outweigh the increased costs of goods?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6ohgoj/what_evidence_exists_to_support_the_claim_that/,468,"A lot of the discussion here fails to take into enough account of the effects of supply & demand. If we bring fidget spinners (or any cheap Chinese product) back to the US, they don't stop making them. We put fidget spinners on the global market for 25% more. Do we think even our own people are suddenly going to be cool with it? It means we buy less crappy stuff. We can argue that it makes the world a better place, but it doesn't make us any more competitive. ",2017-07-20 16:43:25

However, in the country I live in (Brazil), it's not rare to see conservatives and liberals ""playing for the same team"": one of the presidential candidates, João Amoedo,  said he was ""[liberal na economia, conservador nos costumes](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,joao-amoedo-se-diz-liberal-na-economia-mas-conservador-nos-costumes,70002318886)"", which means that he supports economic liberalism and conservative moral values.

This position of the left makes sense when approaching the subject from the world view of my country's politics, where they're often seen as parts (not necessarily in agreement, but still) of the same side, but it doesn't make any sense when talking specifically about the US, where both are frequently seen as parts of a dichotomy.

694,4xhnty,False,,211,A Quality Conservative Podcast?,NeutralPolitics,"Can someone direct me to an intelligent, conservative podcast?  I perused the prior podcast threads but most seem to suggest the left-of-center tracks I already listen to.


I tend to support progressive politics and the media I consume bears this out. The podcasts I currently listen to strive to be either neutral (fivethirtyeight.com Election Pod), left of center (Keepin' It 1600, The New York Times Politics Pod, The Skepticrats), or ""alien""(Dan Carlin's Common Sense). However, I wonder if part of the reason politics has run so hard to the wings in recent years is because we have failed to listen to each other. We stay in our own echo chambers. I want to listen to the other side because it helps me sharpen my own argument, but I might also find a genuinely good idea from time to time.

BBC has a good graphic for the positions of the factions/parties on the main issues of the election: [Graphic](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/E3D8/production/_100282385_italy_where_they_stand-nc.png), [Source article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43291390)

The [results](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi) showed M5S taking the lead as the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, a historic change. M5S got 32.22%, PD got 18.9%, Lega Nord got 17.69%, FI got 13.94%, meaning that the center-right group got around 31.7%. The center-right faction and center-left factions got slightly more than their totals currently because they are allied with groups of smaller parties.

• What was the cause of the shift towards the populist Five Star Movement?

• How much of an effect did party positions on immigration and the European Union have on the results?

• What statements have been made about possible coalitions by the relevant parties?

__**Background**__  
The election took place under a complex combination of FPTP, MMP and PR - First Past The Post, Mixed-Member Proportional and Proportional Representation, after being set in place by the [2016 Italian Constitutional Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_constitutional_referendum,_2016). [This article written before the election](http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/italy-election-2018-what-you-need-to-know-2018-2) goes over the electoral system, the emergence of the Five Star Movement and predictions.


Main coalitions:

The center-left coalition is primarily made up of the Democratic Party (PD), but also includes More Europe (+E), Together (I), Popular Civic List (CP), SVP-PATT, and Aosta Valley (VdA)

The center-right coalition is primarily made up of League/Lega Nord (L), Forza Italia (FI), but also includes the Brothers of Italy (FdI), and Us with Italy (NcI). 

The main parties in the election were:  

• [Democratic Party (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(Italy\)): A center-left party devoted to social democracy and social liberalism. The party is a result of the merger of numerous center-left parties, and has been in power since 2013.   

• [League (L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord): League, or Lega Nord, is a regional right-wing political party advocating populism, federalism and is a strong opponent of globalization, immigration and a soft Euroskeptic party.   

• [Forza Italia (FI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Italia_\(2013\)): Forza Italia, or Forward Italy, is a center-right coalition based upon Christian democracy and liberal conservatism.   

• [Five Star Movement (5SM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement): Five Star Movement is an anti-establishment party coalition with various principles and many factions: environmentalism, anti-globalization, Euroskepticism, populism, direct democracy are some of its core ideals. There has been ambiguity around the party's position on immigration, Grillo (the party's founder) [advocating](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/12/23/grillo-calls-for-mass-deportations-2_c2583737-0f97-4157-a2f3-d2a9137728b6.html) for the expulsion of all illegal immigrants from Italy, but there is no official position. 

The polling had shown a decline in the center-left coalition share of the vote and an increase of the 5SM share of the vote, with the center-right share of the vote remaining fairly static.

For example (from the above article):

>California's two largest school districts announced Monday that schools will not open for any in-person instruction when the academic year starts in August, and that students will continue to learn remotely. Los Angeles Unified School District and San Diego Unified School District are the largest school districts to date to forgo any type of in-person instruction.

[In earlier months, online learning presented a clear challenge to many families and areas because of inadequate or non-existent access to internet services.

The problems are particularly acute in rural areas, where only 34% of households are subscribed to an internet service compared with 78% in urban areas, according to an EdSource analysis of 2018 data.  
>  
>Major progress has already been made as districts, private donors and elected officials rush to get devices to students, but hundreds of thousands of students remain unable to access online learning.

>Rural schools are finding mobile WiFi devices don’t work at all for students in some of the most remote parts of the state that lack broadband infrastructure.

In the landmark case Brown v Board of Education, the [court opinion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483/USSC_PRO_347_483_1) seemed to make it clear that equal access to schooling is a constitutionally protected right:

>Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.

The United States is special in that it also claims [foreign income](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work) as taxable, but only when the profits are repatriated to the USA.

Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a jury of obstructing a Congressional investigation, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.

In that sentencing memorandum, the DoJ sought a sentence within the range they calculated the US Sentencing Guidelines to suggest of 87 to 108 months (7-9 years).

Stone's attorneys [disputed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.280.0.pdf) the guidelines calculation made by the government, and believe the guidelines range should be 15-21 months imprisonment.  They also requested a downward departure from that range, seeking only probation without incarceration.

After the sentencing memorandum from the government was filed, President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227122206783811585)

The supplemental memorandum says:

>The prior filing submitted by the United States on February 10, 2020 (Gov. Sent. Memo.

sentence of incarceration is warranted here, the government respectfully submits that the range of

I understand that Green Parties have their own Political International organisation, the [Global Greens](https://www.globalgreens.org/) with their own [charter](https://www.globalgreens.org/globalcharter).  In the charter, of course is the pledge to phase out nuclear power.


Any Green political party with any influence (whether it is from the U.K, Taiwan or Brazil) is a member of the global Greens movement and holds the same beliefs and policies with little deviation.


However, it doesn't really explain why the stance on nuclear power is such a core tenet of Green politics though.

&nbsp;

So there's really a few questions:

&nbsp;

Why is the anti-nuclear movement so strongly correlated with Green political parties to the point that there's no notable Green/pro-environmental Parties that have a different stance on nuclear power?

Is it because an anti-nuclear stance is a law of nature for pro-environmental groups?  Or is it simply the consequence that coalition/consensus building must inevitably involve anti-nuclear issues?  Because this trend is remarkably consistent.

894,7g67tq,False,,9,How does the UK Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011) impact a finding of contempt against a government minister?,NeutralPolitics,"**Background**

There is presently [a controversy over alterations of reports given to the House of Commons related to Brexit by Brexit minister David Davis.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/27/mps-attack-david-davis-for-handing-over-redacted-brexit-reports)  That controversy has included suggestions, including contempt of Parliament.  Such allegations [would be made to the Speaker, Mr. Bercow, who would then possibly refer it to a committee for adjudication if he found evidence of contempt.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42149793)

Under other Westminster systems, a finding of contempt has been the basis of a no-confidence measure against the government.  Notable recently was the 2011 [fall of the Harper government in Canada on issues of contempt similar to those alleged in the UK.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-government-falls-in-historic-commons-showdown/article4181393/)

Davis is not Prime Minister, but under principles of [collective responsibility of the Government to the Commons](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7755) his position could be attributed to the government as a whole.  It has been argued by Ian Brodie in the Canadian context that [individual impeachment has become depricated by collective responsibility and that if a single minister were found to have lost confidence, it would fell the entire government.](https://parliamentum.org/2017/01/04/on-collective-ministerial-responsibility-and-impeachment/)

However, in 2011 the UK changed electoral laws with the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011)  This law requires that early dissolution requires either a two-thirds vote for a measure that there should be an early election, or else a simple majority must adopt a resolution ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government.""

**Question**

How would a finding of contempt of Parliament against a government minister fit into that framework, if not accompanied by the requisite finding of no confidence in Her Majesty's Government to trigger the FTPA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7g67tq/how_does_the_uk_fixed_term_parliaments_act_2011/,288,"The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has [indicated](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/28/david-davis-risk-contempt-parliament-brexit-reports-speaker) that he would be receptive to complaints of contempt, because there is a difference of opinion as to whether the Government's response to the [Commons motion on November 1st](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/nov/28/priti-patel-condemns-mays-brexit-strategy-and-says-eu-should-be-told-to-sod-off-over-money-politics-live?page=with:block-5a1d5ab69ab3f2056cb1cb0c#block-5a1d5ab69ab3f2056cb1cb0c) is adequate. 

The reports are to be delivered to the ""Brexit Committee"", a Commons Select committee that was formed to mirror the new Department for Exiting the European Union, which insists that it has the initialism ""DExEU"", and whose Secretary of State is David Davis.  Hilary Benn, the chairman of that committee has indicated that he is unhappy with the response so far. [Here](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/exiting-the-european-union-committee/publications/) is where the correspondence between Davis and Benn has been published. 

In that correspondence, Davis says that the Government feels that it has satisfied the requirements, Benn says that he is not so sure, and would Davis appear before the committee to explain? The Speaker's comments today appear to mean that Davis *is* in contempt if he does not appear, and that he *might be* in contempt if the committee votes that it is unsatisfied with his appearance.

My reading between the lines leads me to believe that the procedure would be:

* Wait until Davis has appeared before the Brexit committee (it seems that Monday next has been penciled in).

* If he is successful in persuading them that he has given everything that the Commons motion required, he is effectively free of contempt charges, and the argument would move on to who gets to decide what is published from the reports (the committee feels that it is their decision, though they will consider ministers' opinions on the matter).

* If the committee are *not* satisfied, then they will likely subscribe to a letter to the Speaker alleging contempt.

* If the Speaker feels that there is a case to answer, he will propose that the Commons set up another committee to consider the charges. The Government would oppose this, and it would only go ahead if the Commons voted for it against the Government's wishes. The DUP is not obliged by its [confidence and supply agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conservative-and-dup-agreement-and-uk-government-financial-support-for-northern-ireland/agreement-between-the-conservative-and-unionist-party-and-the-democratic-unionist-party-on-support-for-the-government-in-parliament) to vote with the Government on this, and several Conservative members expressed dissatisfaction with the Government's response.

* If the committee were set up, it would have to consider carefully and give the Government every chance to back down, but it could eventually recommend a vote in the Commons, and they would suggest possible sanctions.

* the House would have to vote against the Government again to confirm the contempt and the appropriate sanction.

* The Government could propose a motion which negates the effect of the November 1st motion, and if it passed the problem would go away.

* The sanctions could include suspension or expulsion of David Davis from the Commons. This would [put pressure](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05226/SN05226.pdf) on the Prime Minister to either appoint him to the Lords, or maintain him as a minister without him being accountable to Parliament, or dismiss him as a minister. Her action or inaction on this could easily be the subject of a no-confidence motion in the proper form for the FTPA. 

* There is nothing to stop the Opposition from proposing a proper no-confidence motion at any time (and the current practice of the Government is to order its MPs not to vote on Opposition motions!) but the DUP *are* obliged under the confidence and supply agreement to support the Government on this.

* The Government also has the option of proposing a confidence vote, making it clear that voting confidence in them would supersede the November 1st vote (""if you have confidence in the Government, you must allow them to govern in the way it sees fit"").

So the Commons can throw a member out, and that would place the PM in a difficult position if the member were a minister, and the PM didn't want to sack the minister. The PM's response to such a crisis could easily be the pretext for a proper no-confidence vote in the Government. It is entirely possible for the Commons to have the votes to expel a minister, but not the Prime Minister or the Government (you could have a ""no confidence in the Prime Minister"" vote which, if lost, would force the PM to resign but not risk an early election), although the distinction could seem jesuitical until it happens. 

How the Commons votes is the only thing that matters, what they say and what their party membership cards say are irrelevant.

Just to be pedantic on the FTPA, a no-confidence vote is followed by a two-week period in which a new Government might be formed, or the previous Government might regain the confidence of the Commons. If that period expires, or if there is the two-thirds vote, an early election is called. 

It is interesting to note that both major parties have procedures for electing new leaders which last longer than the no-confidence/early election scenario, and so an election could be held where a major party had no leader.

Given that many of the Democratic candidates running for President have their own plans for student loan cancellation (most notably [Sen. Warren](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/24/elizabeth-warren-2020-student-loan-debt-1428361) and [Sen.

My Questions:

* What are the legal paths and executive powers that a sitting president can use without congressional legislation to forgive any amount of student debt?
* Are there prior examples of US Presidents forgiving student loan debt that did not require congressional approval?

>After an extensive and fair investigation and according to Department of Justice procedure, the Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided its report on allegations of misconduct by Andrew McCabe to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).


>The FBI’s OPR then reviewed the report and underlying documents and issued a disciplinary proposal recommending the dismissal of Mr. McCabe.  Both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.



>The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability.  As the OPR proposal stated, ‘all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand.’ 


>Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department’s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.”


[Here is McCabe's statement](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/mccabe-fired-statement-fbi-deputy-director/index.html) criticizing the decision:


>I have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time.


>For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The President's tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us.


>No more.


>The investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.


>The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.


>But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.


>Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday's comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.


>This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.


>I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was privileged to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.


>I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred.

What is the most likely or most viable way that the US federal government could ban a website (or app) without requiring a new law from Congress?

What challenges would that ban face?

Bonus question: What tends to be the threshold(s) that a Chinese owned company must exceed (% of Chinese ownership, activities, proof of censorship, proof of embedded CCP members, etc) for that company or their products to receive sanction-like actions from the US that go beyond standard regulations?

# Context

US White House administration confirmed that WeChat and TikTok [are each facing scrutiny in the US](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/wechat-backlash-us/) and the administration is threatening to ban them.

Every major internet censorship initiative that I know of at the national level [are acts of congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States#Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act_(CFAA)).

Even the best explanations I can find about how a ban would work cast significant doubt on any options that do not need congressional approval:

* US Commerce Department could put TikTok on its [""entity"" list](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list)  but the US government blocking traffic to TikTok is ""unlikely to succeed given our legal systems.""
*  The administration has limited authority to ban outright any specific piece of software, like an app. EFF general council says ""There is no law that would authorize the federal government to ban ordinary American from using an app.""
* A law or executive order that targets TikTok could spur a challenge under the First Amendment using rulings such as [Bernstein v. DOJ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech), in which the court found a computer scientist had the First Amendment right to publish an encryption algorithm. 
* ""The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is [already investigating TikTok](https://www.cnet.com/news/us-launches-a-national-security-review-of-tiktok-report/) for national security concerns...could end up requiring changes to TikTok's substantial operations inside the US."" But that started in November 2019, and its not clear to me when that wraps up and what impact it can have in the grand scheme of things.

Here is an old CGP Grey video on it for those who aren't familiar.  This video helps get an intuitive grasp of simple forms of gerrymandering:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY


Gerrymandering is a common action in the US today and results in entrenched districts being created.  Groups like FairVote, and others have cited this is a cause for concern.

http://www.fairvote.org/gerrymandering#gerrymandering_key_facts

Some sources claim that gerrymandering does not reduce the effectiveness of local representation (in terms of obtaining local funding), although it can skew party representation:

https://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/research/gerrymandering.pdf

A summary of alternatives (as well as a discussion of the broad unpopularity of the current system) is discussed here:  https://news.virginia.edu/content/citizens-don-t-gerrymandering-study-offers-alternative-redistricting-methods

Should this be a legislative focus to fix, and if so, how should it be done?  Are the efforts in California and Iowa (described in the previous link) a good approach?

This may not be politically tenable, given that many reports claim that Republican majorities in the House stem directly from gerrymandering efforts over the last decades.

This question has 2 parts. First one is how wide is a space of decisions, whether it's completely binary (accept/not accept agreement) or there is a set of points in between?

And second part is what decision represents common ground between positions of his supporters and opponents? Of course, if it's possible to find some compromise at all.

The order is likely to meet outside legal challenges (From 1st source):

> A parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre-written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as “an outrageous abuse of power” by an “unstable and increasingly autocratic” president, as one of the groups, Public Citizen, put it.

In Congress, there is potential for [a joint resolution to block the emergency order](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-congress-national-emergency.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), however without two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate, the president could easily veto it:

> Under the National Emergencies Act, the House and the Senate can take up what is called a joint resolution of termination to end the emergency status if they believe the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated.  

...

> To keep a president’s party from bottling such a measure up, the law says that if one chamber passes such a resolution, the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days. Though Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, they would need only a handful of Republicans to join them to pass the resolution there and send it to Mr. Trump’s desk. 

Aside from a joint resolution, The New York times describes the House as having two legal options: Democrats could either sue or they could join a third party lawsuit. There is a caveat in that if the House itself sues, they might not have legal 'standing' (From 3rd source):

> There are questions about the House’s legal standing if it were to try to sue on its own, and House leaders and their lawyers will have to decide if it is worth risking filing suit themselves only to be dismissed by a judge for lack of standing. 

----

I have a few questions about lawsuits involving Trump's emergency order:

1: Do Democrats have legal standing to sue over Trump's emergency declaration? Specifically, how could they gain standing?

2: Democrats might also join a third party suit. Are there any third party groups or individuals that would certainly have standing against Trump's order?

Bonus side thing: What is legal 'standing'?

Opponents argue that the executive order would violate the Section 1 of 14th Amendment of the United States, which states that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""

Economic sanctions are for the most part imposed on individual entities, not countries (there are some exceptions, like the [embargo on trade between the USA and Cuba](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/cuba/)). These entities are in some cases arms of national governments (stated-owned enterprises, government officials, militias, government agencies, etc). They can also be private citizens or private companies. In fact, these sanctions are not even imposed directly on most of the SDNs: Treasury ultimately enforces SDN sanctions by [imposing civil penalties](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/CivPen) (fines) on Western companies and individuals, since they represent the only entities over which OFAC has enforceable jurisdiction. As an example see [this case against TD Bank in January 2017](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/CivPen/Documents/20170113_td_bank.pdf), in which the bank agreed to pay about $0.5 million for voluntarily self-disclosed (presumably inadvertent) violations of Iran and Cuba-related asset control regulations.

The [Iran-related sanctions that were imposed on February 3, 2017](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20170203.aspx) do not solely target Iranian entities. Some of the 25 individuals and firms targeted are reportedly from Iran, but others are from Kuwait, the UAE, China, and Lebanon.

In economic terms, the actual substance of this round of sanctions does not appear to be all that different from what we've seen in previous rounds under Bush and Obama. But in keeping with what some other commenters have already said, the critical issue here may not be the economic impact of the sanctions, but rather the administration's very conscious choice to use this as a means of [arguably counterproductive saber-rattling](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827118012784373760).

They aim to limit food riots (most prominently remembered over Nutella), to pay farmers more, and to strengthen small producers overall. What evidence supports the pros and cons of this legislation?",NeutralPolitics,"In the first three months of this year, several laws came into effect in France that aim to limit riots over discount foods, to distribute equity more fairly among stores and farmers, and to strengthen small producers by making big brand products more expensive.

---

Partially in response to discount food [riots in 2018 over steep Nutella discounts](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42866417), France [passed legislation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/31/france-slap-legal-limits-food-discounts-wake-nutella-riots/) to stymy the cause of rioting at big box stores.

In January, France first put limits on how steep discounts can go:

> ...limit discounts to 34 per cent – half the Nutella price cuts...

In [March, they effectively killed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/02/16/big-brand-food-shopping-just-got-more-expensive-in-france/#79676a32a165) 'buy one get one free' promotions:

>  ...the amount of promotions which are allowed will be limited to just a quarter of the planned sales. So if a supermarket wants to sell 100 tubs of Nutella, from March, it can only run promotional offers on 25 of them.

---

In February, France effectively raised the cost of certain foods by 10%, but it's a little more complicated than that. According to French Minister of Agriculture and Food, Didier Guillaume, [the purpose is to spread more equity to farmers](https://www.20minutes.fr/economie/2439575-20190130-loi-alimentation-changements-panier-courses-vendredi) (Google translated from French, full interview [here](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/8h30-fauvelle-dely/loi-alimentation-il-faut-peut-etre-que-la-distribution-fasse-moins-de-profits-affirme-didier-guillaume_3146611.html)):

> ""What I'm asking big box stores is to find a way to spread the margins differently, to distribute things better, the objective is that agricultural products are sold at their fair value,"" argued the minister. The State hopes that, in return, the distribution will better pay producers from all sectors of agriculture and aquaculture, struggling because regularly paid below their cost.

Some more specific info on this measure (from source 4, 20Minutes, and through Google Translate):

> The recent Food Law raised the ""resale loss threshold"" or SRP to 10%. The government wants to force distributors to sell their calling products at prices 10% higher than those they have purchased. These products, which generate no profit but attract the barge, can no longer be sold at a loss. Specifically: a product bought 1 euro must be sold at least 1.10 euro.

> From 1 February, in supermarkets, ""500 products out of 13,000"" should increase, while in hypermarkets ""it is 800 products out of 20,000"" are concerned, according to the minister, who confirmed by relativizing information published in Le Parisien. Rather, they are consumer goods manufactured mostly by food giants (Danette, Coca-Cola, Caprice des Dieux, Ricard, Nutella, etc.) used by distributors in their promotional communication to attract the public. According to the Paris daily newspaper, the 750g Nutella pot would thus go from 4.05 to 4.39 euros, ie an 8.4% increase.

----

Cumulatively the effect of these laws strengthens the position of smaller suppliers (source 3, Forbes):

> The rationale is that supermarkets attract customers through promotional material of big brand products such as Coca-Cola, Danette, Ricard and Nutella, with whom smaller producers cannot compete. It’s an attempt to help farmers and smaller producers to become more competitive as they are now guaranteed a fair price.

Fox News has recently written an article that says: 

>It routinely is the most overturned court in the U.S. In 2012, the Supreme Court reversed 86 percent of the rulings it reviewed from the ninth.

and that

>Critics deride the court, calling it the “Ninth Circus” and the “Nutty Ninth.”

The LA Times also has an article about the 9th Circuit from September of last year on the subject of it's alleged left-leaning bias. To quote: 

>The court’s reputation for leftist judicial activism is so legendary that conservative groups mount perennial efforts to split up the 44-judge court, the largest in the nation. In 2011, Newt Gingrich called for abolishing the “anti-American” circuit outright.

The article discusses some of it's historical appointments and liberal biases but comes to the conclusion that it's overturn rate is due to the size of its region and the huge amount of cases it sees. 

On the other hand liberal-leaning news sources (in my opinion) such as ABC take the stance that the liberal reputation of the 9th Circuit is overblown. According to ABC the 9th Circuit appears very liberal because of the large influx of appointees in Carter's administration. ABC says that these ""Carter"" judges are too advanced in age to matter or are simply dead. 

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/scholars-liberal-reputation-9th-circuit-overblown-45316853

>But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit's liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter's appointees — who were considered extremely liberal — have taken semi-retired ""senior"" status or passed away.

Other organizations such as the American Bar Association have rated the 9th Circuit very poorly and has given it the second lowest grade of any federal circuit.

Only 14/44 of the active and open seats (only 4 vacant seats at the moment) in the 9th Circuit have been appointed by conservative presidents ( Reagan, Bush Jr and Sr, and Nixon). The rest have been appointed by Carter, Clinton, and Obama. 

Is the 9th Circuit truly a liberal biased court, in the way certain media outlets are making them out to be?

How has it influenced trade negotiations between Russia and the US?,NeutralPolitics,"In 2012, the United States Congress passed a law known as the Magnitsky Act that barred certain Russian citizens from traveling to and entering the United States. The law requires the government to identify Human Rights abusers from Russia, and bar them from entry. 

This act was passed as a clause in one of the first formalized trade agreements with Russia (since the fall of the USSR) where:

> The most immediate effect of the bill would be to formally normalize trade relations with Russia after nearly 40 years. Since the 1970s, commerce between Russia and the United States has been subject to restrictions that were intended to punish Communist nations that kept their citizens from emigrating freely.

Some discussion questions: 

* How has the Magnitsky Act influenced US-Russia relations? How frequently is it invoked? 

* Or is it keeping high-profile financial criminals and human rights abusers from Russia out of the US? 

* Has it been effective in at least impeding the interests of the people the Magnitsky Act was intended to work on (at least in the US)?

* How has this law impacted Russian entry into the US since the law went into effect? 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6ng7l1/how_has_the_magnitsky_act_impacted_russian_entry/,353,"There are currently 44 individuals sanctioned under the [Magnitsky Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6156/text) (P.L. 112-208, enacted in late 2012). As it says in the *FP* article you link to, most of these individuals are fairly low-ranking officials in the Interior Ministry, certainly not Putin confidantes for the most part.

When you refer to ""formalized trade agreements"" you're referring to the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a provision in the 1974 Trade Act that denied permanent normal trade relations to countries that restricted emigration (i.e., the then-Soviet bloc). As part of the Magnitsky Act, the application of Jackson-Vanik to Russia was repealed (in other words, trade between the USA and Russia was normalized). So, this was not exactly a ""trade agreement."" It was a unilateral action on the part of the U.S. Congress. It has become customary for Congress to eliminate the application of Jackson-Vanik to countries once they have acceded to the World Trade Organization (see for instance [China in 2001]( https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22398.pdf), [Albania and Kyrgyzstan in 2000]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/434/text)).

So basically, Congress formalized a more-liberal trade regime with Russia while simultaneously mandating sanctions against Russian nationals. If that seems odd, well, the process of deal-making in Congress often involves both sides making concessions. In this case the more trade-focused legislators got their wish on Jackson-Vanik, and in exchange the more human-rights-focused legislators got a new tool with which to exert pressure on Russia.

But this is all, arguably, not as relevant given the developments in U.S.-Russia relations since the enactment of the Magnitsky Act. The Magnitsky sanctions are much less economically significant than the Ukraine-related sanctions applied in the wake of the Crimea annexation. Magnitsky does not target major oil, gas, construction, and banking firms, whereas the Ukraine-related sanctions under the 2014 and 2015 Executive Orders (EOs) target dozens of major companies in these sectors.

Two things that could result in a much greater impact than Magnitsky, however: (1) The EOs signed after the Crimea annexation and Russian actions in eastern Ukraine and (2) the so-called “[Global Magnitsky Act]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/284/text),” which passed the Senate but stalled in the House in 2015. The EOs ([#13660]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo.pdf), [#13661]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo2.pdf), [#13662]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo3.pdf), and [#13685]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo4.pdf)) have resulted in regular sanctions against 160 people and 129 entities (companies, militia groups, etc). Special “sectoral sanctions” (mostly restricting access to financial markets) have been imposed on 278 entities as well.

So, in summary answer to your bullet-point questions:

* The Magnitsky Act has certainly affected U.S.-Russia relations, but probably not nearly as much as disputes over Ukraine, Syria, and alleged election meddling.

* The 44 individuals sanctioned under Magnitsky are probably not likely to come to the United States anyway. It’s largely symbolic in this way, kind of like [Russia applying sanctions on U.S. legislators in 2014]( http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/20/obama-authorizes-new-sanctions-on-russia-over-crimea.html).

* Again, Magnitsky has likely not affected the individuals in question all that much. Some of the people sanctioned under the Ukraine-related EOs, however, may well have found that sanctions “impede their interests.” Wealthy businessmen like Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg own assets all over the world, so their presence on the non-Magnitsky sanction lists likely affected them.

* Again, the Magnitsky-sanctioned individuals are unlikely to have tried to enter to USA, with or without sanctions. But the Ukraine-related sanctions may very well have impeded travel for some of the jet-setter types on the list.

By the way, to reproduce the numbers I cite above for people and entities sanctioned under Magnitsky and the Ukraine EOs: Go to Treasury's ""[Sanctions Search](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/)"" website, select ""MAGNIT"" or one of the ""UKRAINE-EO"" options under ""Program,"" and click ""Search."" You can then export to Excel and run a count of the totals. ",2017-07-15 14:31:03
